panjatogo,AskWomen,1389813339.0,"I believe the reason ""multiple orgasms"" are even a concept is because guys can only have one in a lengthy time period. By comparison, having more than one in a shortish period would be considered ""multiple"" relative to guys. Having one long one that continues for a long time is something you can do for the same reasons you can have multiple consecutively. It is, then, entirely semantic (in my opinion as a guy who has never experienced multiple orgasms in any form) whether or not there was significant pause after one orgasm to call the next a distinct orgasm."
Ralkir,changemyview,1389813341.0,"&gt;So if they like to fight the very sexism feminism is also opposed to, then why do they hate that same feminism?

Because Patriarchy theory is the most widely in accurate theory for society that feminism continues to perpetuate as absolute fact. ""Oh look here's a subset of the male population (let's be generous and say 10%) they are all in positions of authority. And oh hey look here's another subset of the male population doing the most dangerous, low end work jobs there are and also homeless (once again let's be generous for your side and say 20%). Holy shit society totally favours males even though more men get the absolute shit end of the stick.""

Patriarchy theory is a croc. Seriously look at the actual number of males in positions of authority compared to the actual number of males there are. And then I want you to look at the homeless males, the males working in mines, construction, wood industries and every other job that has the most work place deaths, and also other bottom jobs like janitors and taxi-cab drivers. And I want you to compare those numbers vs the total male population. THEN I want you to come back and tell me that men as a whole are more privileged, when the vast majority of them have the privilege of working at society's underbelly."

Here is a little timeline/story that proves I might not be the one trying to save face here, and it might be someone else.

So let's see...

---

1) /u/BeartoothBand does an AMA, the account is [verified.](http://i.imgur.com/YdjHq5d.jpg)

2) I talk to Caleb on /u/BeartoothBand via PM and he says he is making a personal account because he liked the site. [He tells me the username is /u/CalebSlowmo, and then asked if he could have the tag next to his name in the subreddits where people may know him. I said sure.](http://i.imgur.com/S7rFlAK.png)

3) He does an AMA on his new account after a while. He even did a joke one in /r/corejerk on the same day just for fun. A week beforehand or so, I even made /r/Beartooth for him when he asked how to make/design a subreddit for a band [(check out the [deleted] account name submission).](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beartooth/comments/1v7sap/picture_from_our_show_in_cincinatti/) Anyways, in his AMA(s), he talks about kicking Austin Carlile out of Attack Attack! and leaving him in the middle of nowhere (confirming the rumors, and adding a few details), talks about the reason why Austin Carlile was kicked out, among other things.

**Remember when Attack Attack! released a statement years back about Austin Carlile getting kicked out of the band, but then deleted it?** Sounds a little bit familiar...doesn't it?

I don't think I sound crazy when I say, THAT ALONE says **a ton.**

4) The very next day **the account is deleted** and then Caleb *immediately tweets* saying that it was all fake, then it gets posted here.

So to say that I'm the one trying to save face here is kind of silly. I think I know someone that needs to save face though. That's for sure.

---

EDIT: lmao, I realized that all of the hostile comments in this thread calling the mods out were coming from people that I had never seen in this subreddit before and thought it was a bit weird. So I did a quick google search and found out that you, /u/jablomi, and /u/tlums are in Beartooth if your reddit usernames are the same as your twitter usernames LOL. That explains a fucking ton.

EDIT 2: [Took a little while to find, but here you go.](http://i.imgur.com/S7rFlAK.png)

EDIT 3: The account /u/BeartoothBand was just deleted right after I posted my second edit above with the screenshot of the PM conversation with Caleb, L O L.

EDIT 4: A member of the band [is now claiming that the original /u/Beartoothband account was *hacked,*](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/1va9oc/the_caleb_shomo_iama_yesterday_was_fake/ceqcjqu?context=1) which is the reasoning behind why it was literally deleted minutes ago. Totally not because I went and took screenshots of the PM convos I had with Caleb that proved the whole thing wrong, haha.

---

To summarize things:

Caleb nukes his account after saying something he shouldn't have (probably about someone associated somehow with the band), and then the band swarms into this thread the instant it gets posted and comments everywhere about how terrible the mods are and how they didn't verify shit. This isn't a PR move at all, nope. The mods just suck and didn't verify anything!

Millions of dead, even more displaced, and religious crazies jumping out of the woodwork. Hell, the Middle-East was up in flames before the Meteors even hit. Stateside you couldn't even finish breakfast without hearing about another shooting or bombing.

So essentially we had an offense that was a large portion second stringers or guys playing a position that they weren't drafted to play. Injuries do happen, but IIRC the Bucs had the most players on IR throughout the season and a large portion of those were on offense. Glennon wasn't even our original QB. Can you imagine how Seattle's D would fare if Sherman and Bennett was the only starters left? I'm going to go out on a limb and say not so well. I think our Wright (our WR/TE) was our third guy to start at TE. I'm not going to lie and say that we don't need depth, but that wasn't the only thing that was killing us, injuries happen, but they don't usually take out a majority of your offensive unit. "

Lady_of_Shalott,relationships,1389813731.0,"In addition to what's already been said here, I feel like you're letting his ADHD be an excuse for his immature and immoral behavior, and it's really not. 

I know someone who is ADHD and unmedicated. They are the head of their household and are fairly high up in a well-known company. I was also diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and now I'm in my mid-20s, unmedicated, in school with a high GPA, and able to manage my own finances pretty well. You have ADHD, you're medicated, and you're able to budget and plan and hold down a successful job. So I don't think it's fair to make excuses for him or blame his bad decisions on his disorder when a.) he's medicated, b.) it's clear that some of us are just fine. Sure, maybe it's harder for us to remember things or not make impulsive decisions, but these things can be compensated for with good habits and coping mechanisms and I don't see him making that effort, according to what you've written here. He's acting like an overgrown child more than an adult who's ready to be a father.

He might benefit from seeing a counselor who can help him develop those good habits and coping mechanisms, if it wouldn't make him feel ""too guilty/defensive."" But as I'm sure you know, mental health professionals can mostly only help those who want to be helped. He might not be willing/able to change, and if that's the case you need to ask yourself if you're willing to stay and have kids with an incredibly irresponsible person, or if you'd be better off dumping him and finding someone who can actually act like an adult."

I did not suggest another form of payment, she was panicking and crying as she told me her problems, and when I didn't cave she looked up at me with her red teary eyes, stood up, kneeled in front of me, and proceeded to undo my pants and give me a blowjob.  I sat frozen like a deer, and after a couple minutes she climbed on top of me, pulled her dress up and panties to the side, and road me in my living room.

I gave her the pills, and told her from now on just ask, and if this wasn't just a fix thing to come back anytime.

ankylosaurus_rex,ABraThatFits,1389813887.0,"No bra is going to fit perfectly for every possible contortion of the human body.  Every bra will gap for you at some part of the day.  Moulded cup bras are even less forgiving, so they will gap more often.  In general, you should judge the *fit* of a bra while standing up normally, no slouching.  So, as far as *fit* goes, I'm only going to judge your second and third pictures.

I think one of two different things is going on here.  It's either that you've got too big of a cup (and should give this a try in 30D), or that this bra is too FoT for you.

When you scoop and swoop, then stand with good posture, how does the bra fit on your larger breast?

You'll notice that I emphasized *fit* earlier.  That's because if the gaping bothers you, don't keep the bra.  It may fit well, but if you don't like how it behaves, then it's not worth keeping."
0x_,offmychest,1389813888.0,"&gt; I'm only doing the government's if people equate radical with bad.

People do, i'll refer to the [overton window again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window). See the progression, between radical and popular. 

&gt; If you take an illegal action and continue to take it until changes are made, then you're not compromising, you're refusing to compromise.

But what kind of illegal action? Its impossible to tell if you've deliberately mixed civil disobedience with premeditated property destruction for instance.

And if you start off with demands for change, and demand them publicly, and do so through advocacy, lobbying and demonstrations, any ground you gain short of meeting your full demands is compromise.

I have to concede your point there, in regards to the objectives of the civil rights movement, and its relentlessness. There was a certain refusal to compromise.

However, i would say, that equal rights being the objectives, they were not fully met, and arguably it will be a long time until they are.

So can they be said to have reached anything other than compromise, if their demands for equal rights were not met.

Its very hazy, in either of our assertions.

It does however feel a little like splitting hairs at this point.

I still think the word radical has a definition, more establised and defined in politics, than not backing down, or breaking temporary satellite laws like a ban being placed on an assembly point for a peaceful protest.

&gt; Radical is a bit relative.

Agreed. And you argued for it as such, very well. Thank you.

If not pass judgement, we should always try to learn from it, so we dont endlessly repeat it.

If you don't have interest, you don't have an interest. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with that. You like what you like.  You are not boring. You are you. There is REALLY nothing wrong with not having fetishes. 

I like what I like. I'm not into my kinks because I want to be, I am because that's what arouses me. I have worked very hard to find 'normal' love-making satisfying because my husbands needs that from time to time. But that really, really, wasn't easy.  (And honestly, I've been only partially successful. I just figured out how to interpret/feel it in the ways I needed. I still don't get off on just the intimacy of our bodies.)

If you are feeling bored and want to try new things, that is something different. 

I have found the best way to go about this is to figure out *why* I like the things I like. Or *what exactly* it is that's arousing to me.  Then it isn't that hard to find other things with the same ""why.""  

What is it about sex that is arousing to you? Is it connection? Your partners body? Them looking at your body? The sensations? Figuring out the specifics will give you something to go on, you'll know what to start playing with. deeper (or different) connections, visuals, sensation, etc.

*For example. I like fear. Fear is ultimately the 'have to have' for me. If no one is at all scared, or if there is nothing at all to fear, I'm just not aroused. But for a long time, I didn't know that. I thought I liked power dynamics, or pain. And it's not that I don't like those things. It's just that I like them because they involve fear. So I can also like many other things and new things, if there is something or someone to be scared of.*"

Just hoping that these fluctuations will have a downward trend from here. I suppose I did eat a bunch of soup the last couple days. Soooo much sodium than what I was ingesting prior to the last few days.


The main complaint is that my inner thighs are sore! It's so hard to go up the stairs right now. Been like this since yesterday. Argh."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389814071.0,"&gt;  as I believe that private systems incentivize technological growth.

This is, quite frankly, one of the better arguments I've heard against it.

But at the same time, if we researched medical technology half as good as we do with military technology, it wouldn't matter. I don't think government is necessarily bad at researching it's just that it's big priority is a new $100 billion fighter jet and not a cure for cancer.

I'm mainly for universal healthcare because in the context of UBI, it's much more efficient than having UBI subsidize the healthcare system. With the same money to cover everyone, we'd only be able to buy people bronze level insurance plans. You know what you mean?

40% tax = $15k UBI or so with universal healthcare.

$400 a month would be about $5k, and wouldn't be liveable. The idea of UBI is to give people a basic standard of living. a $400 UBI wouldn't even cover rent for a lot of people. And considering what it would replace, it wouldn't be worth it.

If we were gonna go that route, taxes would likely be a lot less though. Probably around 20-25% instead of 40%. 

Quite frankly, I can't see myself supporting UBI below $10k. Below that, it just isn't worth it. What would be lost to fund it just wouldn't be worth it. It would put many people in a worse situation than they are today. "

bombeater,ADHD,1389814091.0,"The most important thing is tone. If you get defensive in tone when you respond to questions like that, people will realize you're uncomfortable and zero in on it, even if they're not doing it on purpose.

What you want to do is, as soon as someone does that condescending ""Golly gosh, you know that's just a crazy thing doctors made up, you don't need all that mumbo-jumbo, just put your nose to the grindstone!"" crap, think back to this thread and take a moment to collect yourself. 

Seriously! Right there in the middle of the conversation. Just fully stop, give a half-assed smile, take a nice long breath, backwards from what you're used to: allow your diaphragm to fill first so your belly juts out a little, *then* let your chest rise, and then exhale through your nostrils. Everyone will look at you funny and get really confused, but you'll feel great. Diaphragmatic breathing is a wonderful way to calm yourself down and take control of any situation, especially high-tension or awkward social situations like this.

Once you've smiled and exhaled and everyone is thinking, ""Oh my God. What's wrong with this guy?"", just ask, ""Why does it matter if I 'really' have it or not?"" Remember: tone is important here. You're not defending yourself because you haven't been attacked. You want to give these people the verbal debate equivalent of a warm, fuzzy hug. Compared to them, you are an *expert* on ADHD, and by casually commenting on your condition, they have invited you to educate them. You are the teacher, they are the students.

Above all, you're asking a question they didn't expect, which forces them to think beyond their prepared socially-trained statements.

Now they have to come up with an answer. Most people's answers will be one of three types:

1. ""It's just an excuse""

2. ""You don't need all those crazy drugs, they're bad for you""

3. ""It doesn't really matter, I just &lt;*bullshit*&gt;.""

There's an easy line of followup for each one.

**It's just an excuse**: ""You know, I actually agree that it's pretty inappropriate to use it as an excuse. If you ever catch me doing that, I won't be offended if you say so. I don't learn about ADHD to use it as an excuse; I use what I learn to make sure other people can still rely on me.""

**You don't need all those crazy drugs**: ""If the drugs help me function like other people and aren't hurting anyone, what's the problem?"" **They're bad for you**! ""You know, I was worried about that at first, and I did some research on it, but most studies show them to be pretty safe. If you find one that says otherwise, I'd be really interested to read it!""

**It doesn't really matter**: ""That's ok, it's not a huge deal or anything. People ask me about it once in a while. It can be pretty controversial because it's so over-diagnosed in children, but it's right there in the DSM with every other widely-accepted psychological condition. The average person doesn't hear about anything except the over-diagnosis, but you probably know plenty of people with ADHD who just don't mention it because they don't need to: they're treating it and they can function just like anyone else.""

They just got schooled."

I think you thought that u/okthrowaway2088 was claiming that the PPG was somehow the cause for the Patriots offense being listed as 20% better than the Broncos', when he was claiming the opposite, that the greater points per game output was a result of the Patriots' greater efficiency.

It's an issue that is drastically blown out of proportion in my view. Some players who use and abuse the AH and 3rd party sites to get their BiS items seem to be the most upset, but the feeling I get from your average player is either that BoA doesn't affect them much or even that it is a good thing because it means any one with top gear ""earned"" that item and you can't bypass content with your credit card. I'm fairly ambivalent on it myself with a lean toward BoA being good, since I would rather have BoA than have a huge increase in botting/scamming/spending all my time on a 3rd party website, etc.

The only other real issue I'm aware of is the so-called lack of an end game, where people were somehow expecting infinite content for $60 or are understandably upset over there being no PvP. Again I don't fall under this crowd because I don't see Diablo as a PvP game, and I would rather have it done right or not at all.

ChangloriousBastard,GrandTheftAutoV,1389814253.0,"How I imagine they'll do it:

1. Player A's money is reset to $0

2. Player A made $X from missions, selling cars, and doing other approved things. $X dollars is added to his account.

3. Player A collected Y bounties totalling $Z.  Player A receives $Z dollars unless $Z/Y exceeds $9,000.  If $Z/Y exceeds $9,000 (the player collected bounties with hacked dollar amounts), Player A receives Y*$9,000.  

4. Any money gifted directly from another player is not added to your bank account.  

5. Money that was split from mission payouts is factored similar to step 3.  If money split exceeds maximum payout/#of transactions, you receive the highest mission payout * number of split payouts received.  

That should give Rockstar a clue about how much ""clean"" money a player has earned.  The tricky part will be on how they decide to deduct money spent.  I personally expect them to deduct money spent (up to a certain point... maybe $100,000 or $500,000).  

So let's use me as an example:

- Throughout my time spent online, I've earned about $2,000,000 legitimately.  Add in my stimulus and I've cleanly earned 2.5 million.

- I was given $85million from a hacker. I had about $200,000 in my bank before this happened

- All in all, I've spent about 8-10 million.  

- After I was given hacked money, I still completed missions and earned money.  

- If we took my legit money and subtracted out what I've spent, I'd be sitting deeply in the red.  

- If they took away my purchases after I was given money, I will have lost money from the missions I've completed after receiving money I had no choice in receiving.  Yes, 90% of my expenses after I was given money was covered by my illegitimate money, but I wouldn't have made those purchases if I wasn't given money (that came to me without asking).  

With that in mind, I don't think Rockstar will take away what I've purchased.  I also don't think they'll leave me in the red or at $0.  I fully expect that I'll be neutered down to about $100,000 or $500,000.   I'm not going to be punished for spending money that came without consent.  Any other solution will leave a huge chunk of the playerbase extremely upset.

I personally find Tolkien's prose to be beautifully written and composed.

&gt; 'For myself,' said Faramir, 'I would see the White Tree in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in peace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves. War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend: the city of the Men of Númenor; and I would have her loved for her memory, her ancientry, her beauty, and her present wisdom.'

Speaking as an American, the way we elect our representatives and decide who can vote hasn't really changed much in a long time. Despite that, as a whole we have all gotten much more intelligent-- free public education and the proliferation of colleges has made sure of that. Even if not all sectors of the population have the same level of access to them, those factors *certainly* can't have made things worse.

My problem here is that we're assuming that we know what intelligence is, and we really don't. We can't suppose that we can understand disparities in intelligence when we don't even really know what cognition is, or what the relative value of different modes of thought are. I think we shouldn't be so quick to ascribe qualities to this data that aren't there. Honestly, if you're worried about a growing ""stupid"" segment of the population, then you should be more supportive of lowering the income gap and raising the threshold of access to knowledge for all.

ronearc,books,1389814464.0,"The only thing positive I can say about the Twilight Series is that it added some interesting elements to overall vampire mythology. 

Vampire mythology is already a rich subjects, and there are hundreds of takes on how it functions and what it includes/doesn't include. 

With Twilight, there were some glaring misses (glittering in the sunlight like diamonds?). However, there were some very interesting additions. 

The very idea that some people are, in life, exceptional and have innate talents, and that when turned into a vampire, those talents are emphasized, grow in power, and basically translate into something of a super-power, almost unique to that vampire...that's interesting. It's different, and I like it. 

It allows you to have a large mix of 'grunt' vampires who are special in their own right, but no more so than another of their kind, as well as vampires who can wield almost legendary power. "

3. Power saving - adds about 30-45 minutes of battery life to a laptop. 

Currently, Hard drives are the biggest bottleneck in almost any computer out there - they are too slow, and the computer is often left idle, waiting for things to get loaded into the RAM, or for programs to launch, etc etc. Speeding up the slowest part/weakest link in the chain has *huge* real-life performance gains. SSD's are expensive, yes, but even at the prices they are at now, it's worth buying them because there is a very real and noticeable difference in performance - paying $200-300 is worth it when your computer tangibly becomes 5x faster at loading and running things.

Try this out as a mantra:

""Being a compassionate human being is not 'sugar-coating'.""

""Being a compassionate human being is not 'sugar-coating'.""

""Being a compassionate human being is not 'sugar-coating'.""

Above all, you have to do some soul-searching and understand *why* you blurt out the bullshit-stomping: how much of it is for attention? How much of it is out of genuine concern for your friends? How much of it is to feel better about yourself?

If you can understand your motivations, you'll have an easier time finding better ways to cope with that immediate desire to rip past your filter and drop truth bombs. Because let's face it, there's nothing inherently *wrong* with dropping truth bombs, and it's pretty fucking fun, you just need to be sensitive to context.

Another possible tip: instead of focusing on not saying anything, focus on *active listening*. Challenge yourself to understand what your friends are saying *so well* that you can rephrase what they said in your own words, with additional insight into their own perspective, so they go, ""Yeah! Wow! That's exactly it."" *Then* you can work on following up those things with ""Well, honestly dude, I see where you're coming from but I feel like there's a much better way to look at it.""

Remember: if you're doing it for *you*, you can hold on to it and rant to someone else, or even just slam it into a journal or Reddit rant. If you're doing it for *them*, you're ultimately on their side, and it behooves you to communicate effectively, which means they're listening to you *and* you're listening to them.

etotheipith,math,1389814707.0,"I'm in no way an expert on group theory, but I can answer these questions:

**What is group theory?**

Group theory studies groups, which are sets of elements equipped with a binary operation (think: multiplication, addition, composition of functions, etc.). There are four conditions the set/operation combination (from here on out denoted as (G and . respectively)) has to satisfy in order to be a group:

* The group has to be closed under the operation, this means that if x and y are elements of G, x.y has to be an element of the group as well.

* The operation has to be associative on the group, this means that for any x,y,z in the group: x.(y.z)=(x.y).z

* The group has to have an identity element e (Example: 0 for addition), such that for any x in the group, x.e=e.x=x

* Every element x in the group has to have an inverse x^-1 in the group, such that x.x^-1 =x^-1 .x=e

Group theory involves every aspect of the theoretical study of groups.

**What's an Abelian group?**

An abelian group is a group where the operation . is commutative on every two elements of the group, i.e. for every x,y in the group, x.y=y.x

**How are different groups defined. What is isomorphism?**

Some examples of groups are symmetry groups, dihedral groups, Lie groups, and Poincare groups. All of those have fairly good wikipedia pages.

Isomorphism means that two groups are essentially identical up to the naming of the elements. It means that the elements of two groups interact with eachother in the exact same way. To put it rigorously (and I hope I get this right): An isomorphism between two groups (F,.) and (G,\*) is a bijection I:F-&gt;G such that for every x and y in F, I(x.y)=I(x)\*I(y)

**What are 'interesting' groups, as far as mathematicians/physicist are concerned.**

The most prominent groups in physics are Lie groups as they model the symmetries involved in quantum physics especially well. As far as mathematicians are concerned, extremely many groups. Quite a recent area of research is the theory of [hyperbolic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_group)."

spriteburn,Scotch,1389814808.0,"On Christmas eve I was with family for dinner.  For the occasion we did the boy/girl present thing where the boys had to buy a 12 year old single malt (no blends!) within the €25 ($34/£21) price range.  [Mine was wrapped in newspaper](http://i.imgur.com/lnWj9ho.jpg) (I can't justify spending money on shiny paper that ultimately gets thrown away).  We assigned numbers to the presents and drew from a hat.  I picked my cousin's boy present which happened to be identical to what I had bought for someone else, so I pretty much bought myself a bottle of whisky.  Fine by me!  I can't remember what the other bottles were other than that big present which was a Singleton 12 with free glasses.  Anyways enough intro, here goes!

**Glen Moray 12**

ABV: 43%

***Colour***

Apple juice.

***Nose***

Icing sugar giving way to sour apple, peaches, and toffee.

***Palate***

Candy floss, sharp, tangy, and intense on the palate, almost overpowering but evolving into a full and rounded flavour of dried fruits in the center of the palate.

***Finish***

Very smooth, warm, and lasting finish.  Toffee.  Mmmm.

***Conclusion***

This whisky is very confusing but I would definitely recommend it.  The initial smell and taste are very reminiscent of a juvenile single malt but at a moment's notice it transforms completely into a surprisingly mature and warming dram with a lasting and pleasant finish.  Definitely could use a couple more years in the barrel to smoothen that initial impact out.  I see that Glen Moray has a 16 year expression which I'm sure does exactly this.  Would recommend.  Costs as much as a Chivas 12, but I think it is much more unpredictable (in a good way).  Speysides are so interesting to drink.  Every one is different despite the high concentration of distilleries."

ebonlance,PS4,1389814967.0,"First off, it's not ""literally impossible"" for many. It's exceedingly unlikely for many but we have way more social mobility than the vast majority of societies on the planet. 

Secondly, it's not that there are more people than jobs, it's that there are more unskilled people than the jobs designed for those people to fill. I'm a software engineer and we actually can't find enough competent people domestically that we have to import foreigners to compensate. We have too many people in the dropout/high-school/college-but-with-useless-major band for the workforce to accomodate. This is solved providing outlets to learn a trade or go to school for something that's actually in demand instead of English Lit, Women's Studies, or Scandinavian Literature. 

The biggest problem is that domestic manufacturing is dying but that's partially because there isn't a good supply of skilled laborers in the country, because we spent a fucking generation and a half telling kids they were too special to do those kinds of jobs. 

The expectation shouldn't be that some sub-90-IQ retail clerk needs a higher wage, but that we should decrease the supply of people suited only to mindless retail work. Raising minimum wage is not going to fix that problem."

Meanwhile parents of a group of these teenagers tried to go after the home owner for violation of privacy because he used the pictures that the kids put on facebook as proof that they broke into his house.  Instead of making their kids man up, they babied them and tried to get them out of trouble.  The problem is lack of consequences and parents not raising their kids to be responsible."

maxwell_smart_jr,statistics,1389814997.0,"There are a few ways of getting around this.  One is to have ""sham"" treatments.  For a particular knee surgery recently, on the control group, surgeons anesthetized participants, cut them open, and sewed them back up without performing the procedure.  This way, participants do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group, and also, it might control for effects of anesthesia and so forth.

For psychological experiments that use training protocols, often there will be a similar training protocol in the control condition.  For studies of the training of visual attention, you might have some participants play a first-person shooter, and others play ""words with friends"" for an hour per day.

So to answer your question, with the careful choice of a control condition that involves doing something for a similar amount of time per week, you can kick people out of your control condition who are non-compliant, or non-motivated."

I'm not ""inventing"" anything, I am deferring to the original intent of the lawmakers and how the commerce clause has been misinterpreted.

Besides, simply saying that it's justified becuase the legal system has declared it so is nothing more than an appeal to authority. Suppose the President made a law that makes it illegal under penalty of death to speak out against the government, and then bribed the Supreme Court officials to declare the law Constitutional.  Your argument is basically that people who say that it violates the First Amendment are ""inventing"" their own interpretations of the Constitution, which are completely different from ones used by our legal system and thus are invalid arguments.  The core of your argument falls apart when you take it to its logical conclusion.

All you're doing is pointing out something factual that I am not disagreeing with - that the government has declared what it is doing legal because it said so.  Your fallacious arguments do not invalidate anything I said."

There shouldn't even be such a thing as a ratting fit, as it should closely mirror the fit we already all use for PvP.

GeeJo,Parahumans,1389815301.0,"**PART TWO: F-S**

* **""Flame""** (*Mover/Blaster*) Pyrokinetic, can travel through flames across great distances, provided he's aware that there's actually a fire at the other end. Isn't immune to heat. Combine the previous two sentences and you can guess at what happened to him - someone put out the fire at his house a few hours before he was trying to escape to it. This did not end well for him. 1/4 Cherokee, but no real connection to that aspect of his life beyond taking advantage of it whenever the opportunity arose. Worked as a school librarian (I think it might have been the same school the **""Outcasts""** were going to, but there was no professional crossover)

* **""Geas""** (*Master/Stranger*). Can permanently overwrite the minds of people he touches with a copy of his own, though the copies become increasingly deranged over time. Has set himself up as a cult leader, kidnapping locals and overwriting them when the fancy takes him. Huge narcissist. Brother of **Takeover**, with a touch of sibling rivalry going on. The two tend to send possessed proxies whenever theyre required to interact with one another, and haven't met in person for years.

* **""Ghostwalker""** (*Breaker*) Intangibility, but it only works \*most\* of the time. Many funny instances of running full-pelt into a wall. Less funny instances of getting shot.

* **""Goo Girl""** (*Brute*) Not a name she chose for herself. Very strong (""lifting cars"" strong, not ""lifting buildings"" strong). Secretes a slime-like substance that, when applied to someone else, gives them a temporary large boost in strength. A black-haired, somewhat chubby teenager who doesn't look after herself very well. Knows that she's something of a laughing stock and is correspondingly sullen and resentful. Has an unrequited crush on **Bacchus**, mostly because he treats her with a basic level of professional courtesy and politeness. He is aware of this but studiously ignores it, neither exploiting nor encouraging it. Member of the **Outcasts** until that group’s disbandment.

* **""Gremlin""** (*Breaker*) Case-53 type, goblinoid in appearance. Any normal technology and the vast majority of tinker-based technology will stop functioning in his presence. Favours blunt weapons, tends to mutter to himself.

* **""Hiccup""** (*Blaster*) induces uncontrollable hiccups at range. Likes to do so whenever someone's trying to give a rousing speech/monologue. Developed into something like Regent's spasm-inducing power. Personality was pretty similar to Clockblocker.

* **""Hijack""** (*Master*) Can remotely power up and command vehicles. Made his debut crashing an airplane into the Pentagon (this was pre-9/11. Doubt I'd've gone down that route otherwise). Bleached spiked hair, megalomaniac, liked to hear himself talk. Killed **Wildcard**, among others. Final showdown with the players was at a Monster Truck Rally.

* **""Hive""** (*Master*) Can split himself into many, many copies. The copies are dumb, unpowered brutes only able to follow basic orders. He can sense when one of the copies is damaged or destroyed but is otherwise limited to commanding them by voice or gesture. Before becoming a villain caused a nationwide media storm when he demanded that his clones had the right to vote.

* **""Jewel""** (*Trump*) Can absorb other peoples' superpowers, manifesting them as small gem-like stones. Anyone holding one of the stones gains the use of the associated power. The stones shrink over time, very rapidly if they're used. The ""victim"" loses their power temporarily and regains it slowly, though much more quickly if someone's using ""their"" stone. Jewel tended to pay people to let her use her ability on them and then sold the stones on for a profit. Had a side-line gig helping to contain recalcitrant powered villains until they could be safely stuffed into a prison.

* **""Justicar/Justiciar/something""** (*Trump*) Martial artist who becomes immune to powers after being affected by them once. Another miniboss. Pretty sure he was inspired by Star Trek: First Contact (as were **Geas**/**Takeover**, now that I think about it).

* **""Leet""** (*Thinker/Tinker*) A super-hacker, basically. Could interface directly with electronics, break into secure systems, create limited AI programs, whatever the plot required. Would fail miserably against Dragon. ""Ward"" of **Conspiracy Nut/Prophet**, but was the more responsible of the pair.

* **""Martyr""** (*Breaker*) Basically Scapegoat, only he takes on some permanent level of damage whenever he uses his power. When he cropped up in the campaign he was already pretty badly-off - wheelchair, constant pain, etc - but was still willing to keep using his ability to help people.

* **""Midas""** (*Blaster/Breaker*) Limited metallokinesis, strongest with gold. Can transform non-living objects he touches into gold. When his power was made public, it caused massive fluctuations in the price of the metal, though he's still made a tidy profit off of it. Is blind, or as close to it as makes no difference. Somewhat reclusive, though he has his finger in a lot of pies in one way or another. Ended up burning to death after a pyrokinetic set fire to his house while trying to rob him.

* **""Mistress""** (*Master/Blaster*) More limited version of Parian - can control and animate ropes and chains. Professional dominatrix. Dressed the part as a hero, too.

* **""Mogul""** (*Trump*) Very much like Null's power with a dash of Teacher, Mogul used his ability to set up a Scientology-type organisation offering (and delivering) tiered access to powers for a large fee. Typical snake-oil salesman in personality. Driven out of town by the players after he started harrassing **Jewel** - turns out he was actually unpowered and leeching off of his ""daughter""'s ability. I remember one of the players had never heard of Scientology before this guy turned up, and said that the belief system I ""made up"" was utterly ridiculous and no-one would buy into it.

* **""Monster""** (*Master?*) ordinary-looking guy who has an unpleasant aura, intensifying over time from merely uncomfortable to nauseating to terrifying. The process is much faster when he's under stress. Former villain, trying to reform himself.

* **""Navigator""** (*Thinker*) knows the location of anything he focuses on relative to himself - how powerful this is depends on how far you're willing to stretch ""anything"" (does it include ""weak point of my adversary""?)

* **""Nighthawk""** (*Master*). Got teased constantly for choosing such a lame name (""He was fourteen, okay!""), and was tentatively trying to get people to call him **""Warg""** instead, without much success. Could transfer his mind to a nearby animal, though it obviously left his original body vulnerable. Ended up getting killed while possessing a mutt, which then became his ""primary"" body. He at least got to change his nom-de-guerre from that incident...to **""Fleabag""**. His mother eventually adjusted to his new situation, and continues to encourage him to find a nice ""lady-dog"" to settle down with. Player Character.

* **""Ouija""** (*Thinker*) A medium whose schtick was actually real - he could contact the dead and ask them for information (though they weren't always co-operative). Another plot-hook generator, though as the campaign progressed I gave him a few ""Necromancy""-type abilities as a bonus. Indian, late-60s, meticulously groomed and usually wearing a Nehru jacket. ""Confirmed Bachelor"".

* **""Panda""** (*Master*) Can open up a 10' by 10' portal to what he calls ""The Pandaverse"", through which a slow-moving constant stream of wild panda bears migrate. He has absolutely no control over the pandas, but they present a significant hazard, particularly when spooked (no matter how cute they look, they're still wild bears).

* **""Partyboy""** (*Blaster*) Can share his current ""mind-state"" with line-of-sight targets, so tended to turn up to fights intoxicated on alcohol or hallucinogens. A regular (and one-time employee) at **Bacchus**' nightclub. Has been on a number of ""hero"" teams, but rarely lasts long due to his proclivities/""requirements"". Once slept with **Goo Girl** - he doesn't remember it, she wishes she didn't. Is in his early twenties, college dropout, dresses in T-Shirt and jeans even to fights. Incapable of taking anything seriously. One of the players *hated* him, so he tended to turn up whenever I could make an excuse for him to, since the results were always funny.

* **""Picasso""** (*Breaker?/Master?*) Hugely talented artist. If he paints a portrait of someone, it acts like a voodoo-doll - whatever happens to the portrait happens to the person. Had a gallery full of paintings of public figures and heroes when he was arrested, some of which have gone missing or turned up on the black market. Hispanic, brooding.

* **""Plague""** (*Tinker*) Tinker specialising in diseases and micro-organisms - essentially a more restricted Bonesaw/Panacea. Very *very* careful not to step over the line, but hints at having a store of doomsday-plagues ready to go, just in case.

* **""Player""** (*Mover*) He has an object that basically acts as a ""Save Point"" - he can instantly teleport/respawn next to it unharmed, and it happens automatically if he's killed. Destroying the object will stop the ability until he has time to create a new one. Came to a rather bad end when a bad guy paid someone to steal his ""phylactery"" and suspend it over a furnace - he kept respawning and falling to be burned to death. Given he spawned remembering everything that happened, he was never the same after being rescued a few days later. He had a nervous breakdown, broke the phylactery and never made another, retiring to live as a civilian.

* **""Quickjump""** (*Mover*) A teleporter. She always arrives clumsily and off-balance, usually a foot or so above the ground. Bruises easily.

* **""Salamander""** (*Brute*) Enhanced agility, slightly enhanced strength, regenerative, resistant to fire. Mild Case 53 - has yellow slitted eyes and a foot-long tongue. Likes to show off the latter to new recruits for the reaction it gets - also for attempts at picking up women (with mixed results). Player character.

* **""Sandman""** (*Stranger*) pretty much what you'd expect, complete with sleep-dust. Doesn't speak much.

* **""Sentinel""** (*Brute*) Can turn himself into an immobile stone statue impervious to most harm. A handy ability to activate whenever someone was about to land a solid punch. Moderately enhanced strength. Semi-retired after underestimating another ""Brute""-type named **Wrecking Ball**, who snapped off one of Sentinel's arms while he was in statue-form.

* **""Silence""** (*Breaker*) selectively suppresses sound in the area around her, up to and including blast waves from explosions. Reasonably skilled ""cat-burgler"" type - lockpicking, wall-climbing, that kind of thing. Can handle herself well enough in a fight against normals (favouring an extendable baton as a weapon), but easily outmatched by anyone with a combat power. Redhead, freckles, shy around others but self-confident when working alone. Supports her mother, who has dementia. Had a friendly rivalry going with **Slowdown** until ""the Incident"".

* **""Slowdown""** (*Striker*) Minor hero with the ability to alter the *perception* of time in himself or those he touches. Despite the name, he could make things seem faster **or** slower. Combat effect was similar but different to Clockblocker - more versatile in some respects and less versatile in others. Good-looking 19-year-old Jewish boy who liked basketball. Shame about what happened to him.

* **""Soothsayer""** (nickname by detractors ""Bullshit"") (*Master*) No-one in her presence can lie or attempt to deceive. Anything she says is preternaturally persuasive, though the effect can be shaken off with effort if the target realises what's going on. Tends to rely on the latter power a little too much. Ostensibly the leader of the local hero faction, but people try to avoid getting her involved as much as possible. Mid-50s, greying hair.

Well, in a very literal way, the person who you hang out with the most is yourself.

Imagine if you texted a friend at 1 AM and said, ""My God, I'm so frustrated with myself. I need to wake up in 6 hours to take a French test and I've barely studied,"" and they replied, ""Wow, what a lazy schmuck, I hate you when you pull this crap.""

You would drop that person from your life as fast as possible, right? (Right?) That's not how friends talk to each other.

This is so hard to do. It really is. It's one of the hardest things in the world, and I think everyone struggles with it. But:

You deserve to be your own best friend.

Whenever I see a thread title like ""I hate myself"", I want to jump into the comments and say Hey. I don't know you but I'd love to be your friend, and no one talks to my friends that way!

I hope you see where I'm coming from here. Hating yourself feels like shit. I've been there, I still go there sometimes, and I'll probably go there again. It's seductive and ultimately I think it might be some kind of defense mechanism. Sometimes I used to catch myself thinking, ""If I hate myself hard enough, everyone else will pity me too much to hate me themselves."" I haven't felt that way in a long time, and even with my own self-deprecating rant on the new entries page of /r/adhd today, I know I'm better off without that toxic place in my mind. The important thing is to be aware of it and to visit that place less and less frequently over time.

You deserve better. Your post is only one paragraph, but it's clear from reading it that you're not someone who deserves to be hated, especially not by themselves. You clearly have the desire and the ambition to be the best possible version of yourself, and you are struggling, as every human being does. I hereby give you Official Permission™ to feel great about that.

The next step is giving yourself permission.

You're right. but it's unlikely from a political standpoint. Modern liber states are very reactionary when it comes to social reforms.

The financial system that would run that savings system is kinda a bastard, one moral reason for bailing AIG was that , it had a lot of pensions to pay.

Also considering you do build a parallel private fund you'll still need some solidarity tax, to pay the current pensioners. 

&gt;scale with population properly

Rich people aren't making babies anymore, you can't scale that.

I have a libertarian alternative. 

Stage one. If you take care of your grand parents you are exempt from social security.

Stage 2: we offer voluntary room and board, in government subsidies care facilities. 

Stage 3: In 30-40 years, this is planned so nobody is surprised, nobody pays for pensions, but after retiring your parents are your responsability. 

Effects: 

People start making babies and raising them right. 

Senile people are not expected to be able so self manage.

Closer extended families, with less judgement from the parents.

Less taxes, less chances for the state to fuck up.

and the housing market gets somewhat more interesting.

Obviously, not getting divorced at all is in the best interests of the child, but that's not what we're talking about here.  Divorces happen, regardless of why or who initiates it.  The Courts take this stance as well, they don't give two shits about why a couple breaks up (unless domestic violence is involved), they only look at where the child's best interests lie.  That being said, it's also true that the child is best off when the parents make an earnest effort to reach a mutual agreement.  If this fails, it is up to the Court as a neutral institution to either help mediate an agreement between the parents, or make findings as to the child's best interests.  It is each parents job to advocate their position and fight for the arrangement they feel is best for the child.  My argument is that fathers are less likely to do this, which explains the statistical discrepancy you see.  

The other big mistake you're making in your analysis is the idea that a man's income during marriage is his separate property.  It's not, unless you have a signed pre-nup agreement saying otherwise.  In the eyes of the government, at its core marriage is an economic contract.  Once you sign into that contract, you're looking at 50/50 ownership of everything that is acquired during the marriage.  This means mortgage payments.  If a man works and a woman keeps house, they pay off their mortgage during the marriage, and then get divorced, guess what?  The woman has as much claim to the house as the man.  They can either try to buy the other out, get rid of the home and split the equity, or whatever else they agree to.  The woman is also entitled to spousal support because it was her income too that the man was earning.  The logic here is sound, in my opinion.  The woman has supported the man's household, which freed him up to go earn the money.  Thus, she is entitled to her share of that money.  If the man doesn't like this, he shouldn't have entered the contract in the first place.

In my experience, what usually happens is that the man and woman come to some sort of mutual agreement regarding real property and support.  First, men are usually willing to allow the woman and child to stay in the home because they want the child to maintain that stability.  Second, men will actually offer to continue making mortgage payments in lieu of spousal support, thus maintaining his share of the equity should the house be sold down the road.  If the man stays in the house, he has to pay the mortgage payments in addition to spousal support, and he might even get nailed with the woman's moving costs.  In other words, this is a mutually satisfactory arrangement, not men getting screwed out of their entitled property.  

In terms of reaching a custody agreement, a full-time working dad is going to have to make some big adjustments if he wants 50/50.  He's going to have to make sure he can drop-off/pick-up the child from school, have time in the evenings to attend extracurriculars and help with homework, make sure the child has an appropriate living space, etc.  Mothers don't need to make these sorts of adjustments, because they've always been the mom.  The root cause of this isn't a bias in the court system, it's a result of natural social situations in which the mother becomes the primary caretaker by default.  If men want to change this, the impetus is on them to make the transformation to full-time parent.  This is what I mean by fighting for custody."

The number of male victims reporting the same thing happening in their lifetime is 4.8 (estimated 5.4 million)

The CDC didn't track stats on gender for forced to penetrate for the 12 month time span, they did track it for the lifetime time span, and that number was 79.2% female.

so, lets go back to this snippet from your comment:

&gt; (As long as we're recognizing that it's definitely valid to specifically target some ads at men, given that the vast majority of rapists are men, *including rapists of male victims.*)

Mehknic,AskMen,1389815582.0,"I feel like I should disagree here about the focus not being on intake (for weight loss purposes).  If he's eating two plates of food and a 600-calorie can of pasta, he's going to be served much better by reducing intake than by walking on a treadmill and burning 200 calories.  Exercise absolutely has its place, but in situations where you're eating way too much and gaining, cutting intake is a much more efficient way to lose than exercise alone.  The gym also sucks when you're fat.

I put on quite a bit of weight the last few years and finally decided ""fuck this, I'm fat, time to fix it."" - tried regular exercise and results were meh.  Switched to a ketogenic diet, cut my intake by half with minimal pain (not kidding), and quit going to the gym.  The weight is melting off (35 lb in 2.5 months), and all I'm doing is eating less.  I usually don't have the energy to go to the gym thanks to the low intake, and when I do, I'll end up eating more afterwards than I burned thanks to the temporary metabolism shift.

It's not the healthiest thing in the world to be this sedentary, but I've been this way for years and another 6 months of sitting while I'm low-energy dieting is worth losing the 70 lbs that makes going to the gym painful in the first place."

betona,PoliticalDiscussion,1389815590.0,"I got laid off a few years ago and was so grateful for the unemployment money because it's so scary facing a family that depends on you.  Honestly, I was surprised that all I had to do to get the weekly checks was login to a website once a week and click a box where I promised that I'd applied for two jobs. Nobody ever checked on me.  In truth, my full time job from 7a to 6p was looking for a job and I worked it hard.  

But my unemployment ended at 6 months, and there were no extensions for me.  And I have heard more than one recruiter say that they've seen people turn down job offers and stay on unemployment for about the same money (why work?).

I wonder, what if the government were to give a tax credit for about the same money as unemployment checks to employers for hiring long term unemployed?  Not forever, mind you, but for the same cost, a person could get a real salary and even pay taxes, and employers would have an incentive to hire people.

cracksocks,AskReddit,1389815704.0,"So what is your solution...? Are you advocating separatism for intelligent people? Some kind of social stratification? Do these methodologies *really* give us a good idea of what intelligence is? I would argue that no, they don't. We understand how the brain works to some extent, but we cannot say with confidence that we can quantify and compare all of its functions. In fact, ""intelligence"" as we know it is a man-made concept that might not even have any value when applied to the real world. There are so many valuable skills that might not fall under ""intelligence"" as you define it, like empathy, humor, ability to socialize, charisma, coordination, technical knowledge, you name it. We are not talking about a linear progression here. It would be unjust to discriminate against a segment of the population based on a quality that we can't even be sure we have properly defined. 

Secondly, education *does* correlate with knowledge. Of course it does. No matter how naturally smart you consider yourself to be, there's no denying that had you not received any sort of education, you probably wouldn't be able to read. *Everybody* gains valuable skills through education. It is never, ever, ever a bad thing if it is done right, and I think it is your best solution to this perceived problem that still maintains our ideals of basic human dignity. The problem with establishing a meritocracy is that we don't have a reliable way of determining what merit is-- in fact, I think it's entirely context dependent. There is no absolute merit. Even somebody like Stephen Hawking would have little merit if he were a member of a hunter-gatherer society. I think that example makes it obvious that our idea of what intelligence is excludes a lot of valuable information, and that we need to be cognizant of the limitations of our language and common modes of thinking. Most of the greatest crimes of history have been committed against some artificially constructed and misunderstood ""Other."""

Niflhe,AskReddit,1389815839.0,"It was my 21st birthday. My friends enacted what they called 21-Drink Night, where they attempted to give me 21 drinks over the night, mostly just to see how drunk I would get. 

The night started off innocuously enough, when someone handed me some strange concoction with Bailey's on the way into town and a double Vodka Redbull at a pub (followed by a White Russian (and two beers)). Then we drove to Walmart and I had another beer on the way over there. At Walmart I think we bought a six pack of Yuengling, Mike's Hard (because fuck it why not), and some Manischewitz wine for a friend of mine who was decidedly non-Jewish. We pulled up at a friends house, while I'm doublefisting Mike's Hards where he gives me a glass with pine-tree flavored gin and Sprite. At this point, the night gets a little fuzzy.

Apparently I drank the rest of the hard lemonade in five minutes, and the rest of the Yuengling throughout the night. I remember throwing up outside, with a friend rubbing my back whispering, ""It's okay man. It's okay. Give it all back to Mother Earth, she'll take it all."" The main reason this story is popular is because, on my way back to the car I managed to walk completely out of my pants. One second I was walking and the next my pants were around my ankles, on the ground. Didn't even stop me for a second, I just kept right on trucking.

Later, my friends put me in the basement with them to sleep it all off. However, when they awoke the next morning, I was absolutely no where to be found. I think they were secretly hoping I had wandered outside and gotten locked out. Unfortunately for them, I awoke in my room, on my futon, with my pants, keys, wallet, cell phone, and shoes folded neatly by my side. I thought I slept with someone's mom, possibly.

When I facebook messaged a friend to ask what happened, he just laughed. And laughed. ^and ^laughed. ^^and ^^laughed."

However, if we examine a [graph](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/World-Population-1800-2100.svg) of world population we will see that the trend happened around the 1950s. Norman Borlaug's work started in the 1940s and was concentrated in Mexico until the late 1960s when it moved to India and Pakistan. I highly doubt that the majority of population growth was concentrated in Mexico. It was only later that his work started being applied towards Africa and Eastern Asia where the majority of the ""unsustainable population growth"" is occurring currently. Furthermore, I am not sure what you mean by ""degradation of vital natural resources"" because the majority of his work is towards crops, specially wheat.  
  
Global population growth occurred when technological advances made a global market place possible. It was not the actions of a single man that allowed the world to experience that type of growth, however, it is the fruits of his, and many fellow scientists, labor that allowed many of those newly growing population to have a stable food crop. I think in general it is better to allow people to have access to food then let them to starve to death.

Anyways I just have one question for you.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389815986.0,"I think the biggest issues are 1) giving your unsolicited opinion, 2) assuming she is insecure about a trait, and 3) assuming that your opinion has the ability to solve that insecurity. 

In the case of a friend who is talking in front of you about paleness being an insecurity, I think it's fine to give your two cents. Just don't say it as if you assume that the only reason she wants to tan is to please guys. A lot of what girls fuss over is less about being sexy and more just a personal preference thing. I think I look better when I'm tanned and personally I don't really care about guys' opinions on that. But I'm also not sitting around being upset when I'm not tanned. If your friend is really self-conscious, maybe she could use a compliment.

If it comes up again, I would say something like ""If you're worried about what guys think, I don't think it's a big deal. Some guys find it attractive when girls aren't tanned. Actually, I think pale women can sometimes be very attractive.""

See, that's very different than saying ""lots of men, including me, think that pale women are really attractive"". This sounds a bit to me like you fetishize pale women as a category--like you like women *because* they are pale. It's normal for people to have their preferences, and maybe pale women really turn your crank...but your friend doesn't need to hear that. You don't want her to think that you fancy her. "

2. It is the enactment of a lot of the ideas raised in critical theory.

3. It's about the blurring between reality and fiction. The fact that the Navidson Record is the most compelling story is great because the book structures it as complete fiction. It's fictional story that has been tampered with by someone who may or may not even exist being told to you in a book. It's about different layers of fiction and the tension between them.

4. The 'gimmicks' always reflect what is going on in the text. The book loses you and sends you in spirals until you have to go forward completely blind.

Yes, the goalie is our last line of defense, and yes, it's his job to come through for us, and if anyone is delusional enough to say that Crawford has not done so, come here, I'll slap some sense into you, because you are clearly delusional.

But no goalie has a perfect save record and, reminiscent of the way the team has been playing in this slump, if your last line of defense is your WHOLE defense, then dude, you are fucked.

By that point, even if the goalie fails miserably, it isn't his fault alone, because there is an entire team in front of him that the opponents have to get through before challenging the goalie.

I'm not sure if it's the coaching or the players at this point, but they are taking risks and making plays they have no business even attempting given the fact that we can't back our shit up when it goes south quick. It could be much, MUCH worse, we are at least picking up consolation points, but given our piss-poor PK and the way our defense in general is shaping up... well, I'd say we have a good shot at the play offs this year.

Anyway, density outside of Rifts (where the density can vary wildly) is back to pre 1.0.8 levels in Vanilla. Another words, its a lot less density than playing right now is. However as I said they are still tuning this, in fact they had a recent ""focused feedback"" request regarding density, as there have been many complaints about it not being dense enough. The reason was to make it so that you didn't just log on and play where the most dense packs of trash mobs were and never go anywhere else, but it seems they may have overcompensated as many areas are now relatively empty (especially compared to post 1.0.8 on live).

10thMuse,AustralianCattleDog,1389816175.0,"My husband and I have a three year old ACD that we love to pieces!  She is a total hand-full, but is a fantastic dog.  She's the first dog I've had, my husband grew up around heelers &amp; other dogs.

*- What is your current living situation, and how does your ACD respond to it?* We live in a medium-sized house, the dog only has access to the lower level (living room, kitchen, library).  We have a tiny fenced in yard.  Enough room to toss a ball a bit, but not enough for her to get up to top speed.  The yard size isn't an issue since we have a dog park &amp; trails nearby.  And, she doesn't really play or exercise by herself anyways, so it's not like a bigger yard would help if we just put her out there on her own.  Inside, it took 2 1/2 years to get to the point where we can leave her alone &amp; uncrated in the house without her chewing on stuff periodically.  She used to be crated all night and anytime during the day that we left the house (I don't work &amp; husband works from home, so not that much but still).  At about 2 1/2 years old she got much better behaved &amp; doesn't chew.  However, crate training was essential to our sanity and is still nice to be able to crate her when she's muddy or something.

*-How many hours a day do you usually spend socializing and exercising with your ACD? And how many hours a day does he or she usually spend alone? How does he or she respond to this situation?* Usually only a few hours a day alone, most of the day spent with us inside... playing tug or goofing around sporadically, a few minutes of fetch in the yard here &amp; there.  She usually get a decent walk (3 miles or so) or fetch at the dog park on most days.  While she likes exercise a lot, she doesn't really seem much better behaved or happier if we do a lot more.  A day off from exercise isn't a big deal if we're really busy or the it's raining too much, but any more and she gets squirrely.  

*-Would you recommend the ACD as a pet in general? Why or why not?* Yes, IF you are okay with a little chaos in your household.  Ours is nicknamed ""honey badger"" for a reason... and no amount of exercise, herding, or anything else really will suppress that aspect of their personality.  She runs through the house like crazy, she's attached to us at the hip, she chases the cats, etc.  Most of the chew toys you see don't really withstand a stubborn heeler, so there aren't a lot of ""easy fixes"" for their energy. But, they are really fun, clever, adorable dogs.  

*-Would you recommend the ACD as a pet for my family and I given the information above? Why or why not?* Sure, it sounds like you've done your research and have the time &amp; interest to devote to the dog.  The only thing I'd say is that at 18 years old, do you have any idea what your living situation will be in 2 or 5 years?  If you're planning on moving out or going to school, is your dad prepared to keep the dog? It can be difficult to get established as an adult, to find your own place &amp; a job &amp; everything, having a dog to care for won't make it any easier.  But, you will have a fun &amp; loyal companion!

*-Any other tips you think would be important for a first-time ACD owner.* We got our heeler from a breeder too.  While I don't regret getting our specific dog at all, if I could go back I'd probably have gotten a rescue instead.  At the time, I was really concerned with getting a puppy and knowing what I was getting myself into.  I now subscribe to a bunch of ""heeler rescue"" pages on Facebook and realize there are a ton of really quality pups that need good homes.  Not criticizing breeders or judging your decision at all, just sharing my experience &amp; change of heart."

Also, there are of course developmental differences in the brain between males and females, but are these differences inherent, or are they shaped? Not only this, but the physical differences could be a product of social selection. 

My only argument is that with the exception of a few anomalies, the observable and recognizable differences we see in men and women are largely the product of how we shape them. And feminism is not trying to make them disappear or ignore them. It's trying to *value* those differences between men and women, and respect them. So whether these differences are inherent or not, it doesn't particularly matter in the discussion of taking those differences and respecting them equally, which is entirely what feminism aims to do."

But I'm going to do it anyway.

In the SF East Bay, there are three Conservative-affiliated congregations. Their membership totals at least 500, probably closer to 600 or 700.  I'll work with 500 to err on the side of caution.

Now, let's say that one third of those memberships involve heterosexual couples where the woman is not pregnant or past menopause. This allows for pregnant families, single-men, elderly couples, and gay men couples for the rest of those memberships. That gives us 167 women that should use the mikvah in SOME way.

There are, right now, four mikvaot in the Bay Area. One is in the East Bay, about 20 minutes away from the furthest Conservative synagogue in the East Bay. Let's say only half of them use this mikvah, because they either work in San Francisco and prefer to use the one there, or because they love paying bridge tolls to go to the ones in Palo Alto or San Rafael. That means we should have 83 going to the East Bay one.

We have two. I am one of them. That is roughly 2.4% using what I consider to be very conservative estimates throughout.

BandarSeriBegawan,environment,1389816287.0,"Again, you're off the rails. Reproduction, and full reproductive sovereignty, is a right.

This means that no one ought to be penalized or stigmatized for having no children, just as they oughtn't for having eight. And it also means that no women should be pressued by her husband or society to have a seventh kid. She should be able to exercise reproductive sovereignty.

When you start going Chinese and instituting one-child policies or even just penalties for having too many kids, you enter dark territory. This is the territory of sterilizing ""morally bereft"" and ""dumb"" women and men, who in the past, basically ended up being non-white and/or poor people. This happened in the United States for decades. 

What's funny to me, is that what I am advocating for, full reproductive sovereignty, actually has the effect, in practice, of reducing population growth. Access to birth control, women's empowerment, and education - these factors reduce birth rates dramatically. And indeed they already have done. We are already well past our peak population growth on this planet. Our population is going to *naturally level off* because of full reproductive sovereignty. 

China's one child policy is in part so sad because their population would have naturally leveled off anyway, but instead they now have a lopsided gender ratio and an population which is aging unnaturally quickly. It's going to have some undesirable effects for them. 

Anyway, reproductive sovereignty is a human right. No one can be forced to have a child. No one can be induced not to. At least, not without breaching people's human rights."

""In the early 1930's the Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku built three 500-ton submarines of Vetehinen-class for the Finnish Navy. The German firm Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbow den Haag that had been set up 1922 in the Netherlands to evade the peace treaty of Versailles, designed the vessels and supervised the building. The Vetehinen-class were a success and as the Germans did not have any experience of small coastal submarines they ordered a 250-ton submarine from Crichton-Vulcan in October 1930 and the Finnish government reserved the first-hand right to purchase the vessel. The ship, called CV-707 after its shipyard order number, was launched on May 10, 1933 and during the sailing-seasons 1933 and 1934 the German Navy carried out trials and maneuvers in the Turku achipelago. The CV-707 was accepted as a prototype after which 6 submarines of the IIA type were built for the German Navy in the Deutsche Werke shipyard at Kiel.

The Finnish government took over the ship autumn 1934 and during the sailing season 1935 the submarine was in the Finnish Navy's service. When the Parliament appropriated the funds the ship was added to the fleet and named Vesikko.

During the sailing-seasons 1936 and 1938-1939 Vesikko was used for training and maneuvers together with other ships of the submarine flotilla. When the Winter War broke out on November 30, 1939 Vesikko was ordered on patrol and during December patrolled the Gulf of Finland. In December the vessel was docked for winter.

When war again broke out in June 1941 between Finland and the Soviet Union Vesikko and the other ships of the submarine flotilla were ordered out to the eastern Gulf of Finland. In July she torpedoed, east of Hogland, the Russian merchant Vyborg. During the sailing-seasons 1942 and 1943 Vesikko was in patrol and submarine reconnaissance service in the Gulf of Finland and the northern Baltic Sea, but due to vast mine fields and nets the Soviet fleet was isolated at Leningrad and Vesikko did not meet any targets to torpedo.


Vesikko operated in August 1941 in the waters of Hanko.

When the Soviet Union started the great offensive in the beginning of June 1944 on the Carelian Isthmus Vesikko was ordered to the eastern Gulf of Finland to cover the Finnish evacuation transports. According to the armistice of Sept 19, 1944 with the Soviet Union, the submarines were ordered back to their naval bases. In December 1944 Vesikko made her last voyage as a warship and in January 1945 the allied supervisory commission ordered the Finnish submarines to be disarmed.""

viceywicey,AskMen,1389816434.0,"It's true that exercise alone is not enough, a point I will concede, but it also depends on what type of exercise he's doing.  Cardio does not facilitate weight loss nearly as well as weight-lifting.  Is there a variance between individuals?  Of course.  I eat like the OP's boyfriend minus the chef boyardee.  I push anywhere from 2700 to 3200 calories per day and that's to maintain my current body weight and muscle tone.  The moment I drop my intake, I lose anywhere between two to three pounds in a week.  This only goes to illustrate that everyone responds to metabolic shifts differently.  For you, cutting diet works, and that's great.

I would like to note that I didn't say exercise alone, I said ""focus should be less on the amount of food he eats"" and ""more about lifestyle"".  It shouldn't just be about ""you eat too much and need to lose weight"".  My post was suggesting ""we need to be healthier"".  For all intents and purposes, the OP is asking for advice on how to bring this up to her guy, not so much which one is better.  ""Eat less because you're getting overweight"" is, in my opinion, lacking in tact.  ""We should move towards a healthier lifestyle because it's a good change for us"", at least in my experience, works better, which is why I suggested the shift in emphasis.  If he has a problem with controlling his diet and portions, the trade-off is ""continue to eat, but you need to exercise to balance out your intake."""

One more time:

**LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH**.

To have a healthy, functional relationship, you need two people who fundamentally have *each other's* best interests at heart, and he has shown you time and time again that, even though he *thinks* he cares about you, **you are actually lower on his list of priorities than his Netflix Top Recommendations**.

This will not change overnight. This will not change over weeks, or months, or years. **The fact that he feels remorse about taking advantage of you does not mean he'll stop doing it**. He'll just keep taking advantage of you, but now he will feel bad about it and come to you for comfort.

He will not accept that you want to break up with him. He will beg, plead, and offer you everything in the world. He will try to convince you that he's worth staying with. **He will be as dismissive about your taste in men as he is about your taste in movies**. He is convinced that he knows better, so he will try to convince you to stay with him.

You deserve better. You are, in fact, a catch. You will love other men; glorious beta losers with great jobs and a genuine desire to make sacrifices for you, and they will watch an occasional goddamn chick flick with you because they're not worried about being ""alpha"".

When I'm on a date or alone with a girl, I want to devote my full attention to her. I'll refrain from checking social media, texting friends, ect. I feel like the same applies when I'm trying to get stuff done, or engaged with other people. A girl texting me ""Hey"" while I'm at work just seems needy.


To clarify, it's completely different if they have news, like ""hey, I just saw that [insert band] is playing tomorrow night, at blah blah blah"" or ""just saw a taco bell advertising a new item called the cheesy-beany-meat helmet"" or ""just got a new hamster, what should I name him?"" If you have something interesting or funny that you want to share, that's awesome, and a guy should do likewise.

That doesn't mean there aren't plenty of racists in MN, it just means our cultures are different.


SEC schools take more pride in their football then any other conference. It means more down south. It's part of who you guys are. Part of that means rules aren't taken as serious, "" if you ain't cheatin you ain't trying"" has been an unoffical conference motto.

It was no strange sight to see glaciers floating past on the murky river nearby, and so one day we decided to travel up river to find the source with a little jet-skiff we had. 
After about a half hour of motoring, we discovered a HUGE glacial wall that sat upon the base of the river. With extreme caution, we weaved past 4 story building glaciers until we were about 200 yards away. After a few minutes of silently watching, we heard a crackly-rumbling come from the wall. In that instant, a huge chunk of the glacier fell off of the wall, sliding into the river and sending out massive waves. It was incredible to experience the sounds and sight of this slumbering beast coming to life. 


We promptly got the hell out of dodge because glaciers are scary and dangerous and we were getting cold. "

JordanLeDoux,PoliticalDiscussion,1389816799.0,"No, a UBI is not insurance or a safety net, it is a promise from society that simply being part of the society ensures you the things you absolutely require to live and participate.

The only study on UBI that's ever been done was in Canada, and it had a hugely positive economic impact. And no, unless your life is subsidized by other things (such as public spaces, business, family or friends) $400 per month is not enough to live on in the US. It is not livable.

Just as an exercise, try this: suppose you *had* to live, in the city that you do now, on $400 per month, with NO other possibly sources of income or assistance (that means no SNAP, no SSI, no unemployment, no subsidized housing, etc.) for six months.

How much head space? If you're using a bottling wand, it should come out just fine. Cap them and let them age.

At point blank the soda popper does 105 while the FaN does 113 max per shot, the soda popper reloads for 1.23s while the FaN takes 1.65 which means for both shots you get 210/1.23 and 226/1.65 or 170 vs 136 dps. "

Buy a wheel from an LBS and make sure they prestressed the wheel then trued it a couple times. Ask them to do it with the tire inflated to normal riding pressure as well.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389816949.0,"&gt; Remember this is per person. A household might well get $15k.

My plan gives $15k per adult. So $30k for a couple. I do this partially because a lot of single mothers will be on this, and $15k is so they can at least have something to raise their kids on.

&gt;Here's my take on it, and I recognize it's not a popular view, but it's the one that simply fits best with the data.

At the end of the day, what do you get out of any safety net, be it a UBI or some hodgepodge like we currently have? I'd say what we get is insurance against upheaval. When people aren't eating, they may very well revolt and do quite well at it.

Now, the question now becomes, how much above these baselines do we want to provide. I'd argue that, given that there exists free access to education already (i.e. a ladder up and out), it doesn't make much sense to provide much beyond Maslow's baselines. After all, what is the ROI?

Well you see, I'm not proposing this as a social control measure, but as something that will genuinely make peoples' lives better."

progbuck,paradoxplaza,1389817002.0,"My issue with this system would be that it would still represent an essentially hard cap on expansion. It would be impossible, for example, for the Ottoman Empire to double in size over 20 years without devastating consequences. In reality, it did this multiple times without losing any momentum. 

What I'm saying is that expansion shouldn't cripple you, but rather should take a very long time to really reap the benefits of that expansion. Instead, we have this weird dynamic where it's *always* a good idea to expand, but to do so slowly. 

The Ottomans conquered a lot of territory very quickly, but could only assert very decentralized authority over that area. By contrast, a country could focus heavily on internal development and centralizing authority to maximize the efficiency of what they already have.

Outside of London, it's like everything changes, haha. The scenery was fantastic! I seriously never saw so much grassland in my life. I guess my favorite thing, besides the food, were the buildings. It's rare to find a building older than 200 years old anywhere in the US, so to go to these places that's been there since 1200, it's mind blowing. I'm a sucker for old and listed buildings, so to get to see those was a dream come true. And a lot of places in the US were kind of planned, like Manhattan is a grid and it was built to be a city. London (and other places) was building over hundreds of years and kind of grew itself, you know? It was just more authentic and so rich in history. It's just insane how some people can trace their roots back to the 1500.

Triplanetary,DaystromInstitute,1389817108.0,"&gt; What I think is most interesting about the way the Borg are portrayed is that the Federation considers them ""the closest thing to pure evil"" that they'd ever encountered, while Arturis in Hope and Fear says ""The Borg collective is like a force of nature. You don't feel anger toward a storm on the horizon. You just avoid it."" The Federation has a deeply human tendency to ascribe moral value where others see simply a sort of animalistic instinct.

This is a really good point, and goes a long way toward explaining Arturis' anger at Janeway. From his perspective, she's like somebody who passed by and wrecked his storm shelter out of carelessness and inconsideration. So when the storm hits, it's her fault he suffered. Which is reasonable (though Janeway may well have been right about Species 8472 being an even greater threat, at least until ""In the Flesh"" ruined any hope of them being an interesting Borg-level villain).

The ""force of nature"" comment is a callback to the way the Borg were initially portrayed in ""Q Who?"" Q describes them thusly: ""You can't outrun them. You can't destroy them. If you damage them, the essence of what they are remains. They regenerate and keep coming. Eventually you will weaken, your reserves will be gone. They are relentless.""

Voyager's portrayal of the Borg was infamously watered down, due to the necessity for Voyager to, y'know, *survive* its encounters, but when they describe the Borg offscreen on the show they often do a better job portraying its unfeeling menace than when the Borg actually show up onscreen. If only the Voyager writers had realized."

If you follow up on the story, what it roughly boiled down to is the belief that men can't be raped, so since the boy was hard enough to have sex, he's responsible for the child financially."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389817158.0,"I'd at least reduce it, since UBI will cover a large portion of it. 

&gt;As an aside, I'd make it so that student loan debt can be dismissed after two years unemployed. Currently it is pretty easy to get payment differed while unemployed, but eventually the interest would pile up so much that you'd turn down jobs that would otherwise be acceptable because your payments would start again and be unbearable. This would keep some people permanently out of the workforce which I think we can all agree is a bad thing.

You make a point with interest, but IBR (which is what I'm on), is pretty good. If you dont know what that is, it's income based repayment, and if you havent looked into it i would highly recommend it. It could have problems 25 years down the line as interest is soul crushing and you then have to pay taxes on the amount forgiven though. Quite frakly, in a UBI society I'm hoping people won't need to go on student loans as much, since college aged students can put UBI money into education."

Conan is by far the system we all dislike the most. 

I'm not necessarily saying that SW is fluke prone, just that for beginner players it is hard to know what the chances of success are. So you end up just shrugging and throwing the dice. I'm not a massive fan of that kind of system.

I just don't find that SW provides a nice medium between a rules heavy system and a rule light system. I don't feel like it has a good idea of what it wants to be either (the rules for running hordes etc also just seemed weird, is it trying to be a wargaming system also?)."

MarshingMyMellow,askdrugs,1389817219.0,"First things first, benzo withdrawals can be deadly, so be sure to go to the ER if they start getting severe. It's not worth your life. Maybe schedule a doctors appointment for early next week just to be on the safe side. 

Not a doctor, not medical advice:

Klonopin is pretty close in strength to xanax per mg, but is longer lasting. If it were me, I would go with 1 or 1.5 mg of xanax for the rest of today, then start on 2 mg of klonopin tomorrow. then 1.5, 1, .5, .5, .25, .25. It is a fast taper, but if you were only on xanax for 2 months it might be relatively smooth.

Decide on an evenly spaced schedule, set your doses up beforehand, and don't tweak your schedule. Do your best to keep busy to distract yourself from any anxiety or withdrawal symptoms,  stay away from alcohol entirely or that will screw with your taper. If you have to use a benzo in the future, stick to klonopin; it's much easier to taper down from. 

Don't worry about your drug test, benzos will only stay in your system a few days.

Best of luck.

If you plan on seeing the person soon, then don't bother with holding actual conversations.  I have no problem with things like ""how's your day going?"" (so long as the answer is short, not a huge story) or ""they have doughnuts at work today, awesome!"" but beyond that, keep it to a minimum.

My girlfriend and I will talk through gchat throughout the day, but it's very spread out and usually just stuff like ""hey, what time are we going to trivia tonight"" or ""do you need me to pick up anything for dinner?"" and the occasional ""check out this cute puppy!""

I feel the same way about phone calls.  Phone calls force you to create conversation because while silence in person is fine, it's awkward on the phone.  So you talk about anything you possibly can, and then when you're finally in person, there's nothing left.  I'd rather have conversation in person if at all possible, and that's what I save it for."

It comes in part from Borges and his infinite libraries. It's also a satire of academia paper references that at times stop being functional and exist really just to flaunt the writers.

Then there's also the fact that half of the lists contain Nabokovian hidden messages. But not all of them have acrostics and the only way to find out is to keep digging through and go deeper into the book. It's meant to drive you mad.

And the layout of the work usually reflects what's going on the text. The characters start kicking down walls and the text goes through the walls of the page.

I_RAPE_MY_SLAVES,books,1389817376.0,"A lot of people hate 50 Shades of Grey for giving an unrealistic portrayal of a healthy BDSM relationship, but I don't know if that's ultra-problematic so long as people recognize that it's fantasy. I don't have a problem with people have unrealistic fantasies so long as they know it would be bad to actually recreate it (and knowing that seems to be the problem).

There are tons of aspects of BDSM (and sexuality in general) that are fun in theory but undesirable in practice, and there's a lot of fiction that caters to that. Without any negativity implied, 50 Shades is pornography, and the unrealistic fantasy I-would-never-actually-do-this aspect is one of the selling points of porn."

As far as I'm concerned, I have no power and agency anyway...thats why I think government needs to act on the peoples' behalf. Without government, you'd have corporations dictating the rules. You'll always have violence and threats of violence, men with guns, control, etc. It's just the nature of humanity. While it's not wrong to have a healthy skepticism of the state, I think it's foolish to oppose it in its entirety, because it'll always be replaced with something else. ALWAYS.

The first option (indecision) slows the game down dramatically, but I don't feel it is the players fault, it is a fault of the system.

dbaker102194,explainlikeimfive,1389817633.0,"We don't have a global government because back in the day (As recently as the early 20th century) the technology didn't exist to provide the infrastructure needed to effectively run a global government. As a result hundreds of individual governments formed. None of those now modern governments want to consolidate, as that would be a loss of power to themselves. So they don't. As a result, no global government. 

As to your question of ""global governments"", I don't think earth will ever be united under one government (unless there's some serious war that breaks out.) But that wouldn't necessarily be a good thing anyway.

I do think colonized planets would likely be under one government as sovereign nations would claim ""dibs"" on various planets. If you're at all familiar with western europes colonization of the whole world, It would probably be something like that, except ""Western Europe"" would be replaced by ""earth"", and the ""world"" would be replaced by ""star systems"" or whatever.

Also, 4.3 introduces TRIM support.  It will take time and battery to sift through all of your storage and ""set it up"".  This will improve, greatly, over the next few days.  This step is not necessary when flashing a ROM or doing a factory reset.  It will be necessary if you keep your data/apps or copy over a back-up.

You also may not have all of the 4.3 versions of your apps.  This really shouldn't cause too much of a headache, but it might for the apps developed by the lower bitter.

Factory reset does this ""faster"" if you are impatient, but without a back-up, you will lose everything not stored with Google or on a back-up you create.

The update you got is post-patch, it is not the version that received the overwhelmingly negative response.  Sprint never released the 4.3 version with those bugs which is why it was delayed from the original date of early November to mid-December.

A new rom fixes the TW delay and other shortcomings.  By the sounds of it, you enjoyed your phone before, so replacing touchwiz isn't the end-all-be-all for you like many advocate.  Touchwiz is absolutely hated by some and replacing it fuels all advice."

We are not talking about every single foul that might be called when a player brings the ball up the court or has time to gain possession of the ball.  That is completely different from what we are talking about.

I'd really like to see a list of games that you have where a tip-in was needed off an inbounds pass and a foul was called.  So find me a game where there was .3 or less seconds on the clock and the refs called a foul.  I seriously doubt that you will find one and want to know why?  Because refs don't call fouls with no time left on the clock where a tip in is needed because you don't even have time to gain possession of the ball, by basketball rules, let alone get fouled in the act of shooting."

instead of feeling like you've lost something, do something about it. you can't move, but you can at least let him know how you feel about it. talk about the ""what if you find someone?"" scenario. find ways to keep in touch. you can't be there in person, but it doesn't mean that it's the end of your relationship.

but even if it is, you are only *fucking* 18! the odds of you being together forever are slim (not saying it won't happen, but the odds are against you.) enjoy the time you have with him, and cherish the memories. and in a few months or a year or whatever, you will find a new guy. and after him, there will be another. and another. because you are only *fucking 18*! and that's part of life."

I'm saying that the ideas you're espousing were wrong when the Nazis put them into practice and they're still wrong today. They were wrong when all of those people advocated for them, too (I'll also note that two of those four people did not live enough to see the destruction that followed when their views were actually implemented). You can't objectively say who holds merit and who doesn't. You can't say who takes more away from society than they put in. You don't *know* enough. Any single statistical measurement you take will omit so, so much relevant information that it ceases to be useful when making a decision on that kind of scale. You don't have the authority or the ability to make that kind of decision-- neither do organizations, or governments, or anybody else, because guess what? Merit is in the eye of the beholder. Different cultures have different ideas of what is good. That's why we let everybody have a say in how our governments are run these days, because no one person or group can be relied upon to make the best decision. You need to stop presuming that you know more than you do, and that other people don't have anything of value to contribute just because of their score on a freaking test.

I really liked the series right up until faith of the fallen.  Which I thought was excellent.  I'm by no means a Randian, nor do I believe in Goodkind's and her philosophies either.  But I could take and read it to that point.  Faith of the fallen just lets the characters deeds and actions be an example of the philosophy it's trying to evangelise.  But all subsequent books had Richard going off on very LONG... very very long and tedious monologues.  And it was intensely preachy.  All the action and fun was gone.  Just a series of essays on objectivism and selfishness as goodness and so on.  He ruined his series with his zeal for proselytising his views instead of telling a story.  

Also as I reflect back on some of the other books I had once enjoyed I find they use the same plot device repeatedly.  Richard and Kahlan are happy.

Sounds like he has a lot of potential for a relationship, that does not mean he's ready to move on with you. Like he said, he wants to take it slow to really get to know you. 

&gt; t's just tough because usually dating is the time I get completely wrapped up in the other person... whereas here I'm afraid to do so to protect my own feelings, and to not scare him away. 

I don't understand. You're afraid to have feelings for him, or you're afraid to show those feelings to him? If he says he's ready for a relationship, then show you care. If he's as good a communicator as you claim, you can ask him if you can do X to show your feelings and if he's comfortable with that. I'm similar. I say what I mean and mean what I say. I didn't date until I was ready for a relationship. Now I want a relationship, and I say that. 

My ex was not a loving person. She was very abusive. My current gf is very loving and expressive, and I love it.

The most immediate examples that come to mind are my father, my mother's ex-husband, my sister's ex-husband, her other ex-hubsand, my other sisters ex-husband, or my other sister's ex-boyfriend. I mean I've got plenty of people I could discuss that I don't know very well but these are the most immediate caricatures that come to mind.

Also I get the impression that last quoted line was an attempt to insult me by suggesting that I was calling these men assholes because they were capable of speaking to women, which I am not. Just for the record, I do well enough with women, I'm not hurting for attention. And furthermore, these men are definitely, objectively, assholes.

&gt; As an alternative explanation, is it possible that the assholes are assholes to everyone regardless of gender and the key element is not their assholeness but that they actually treat everyone the same regardless of gender?

Try doing 180 hippy jumps (some people call them sex changes but I personally think that name sounds weird so I just call them 180 hippy jumps lol) to switch stances quickly.

I'm not that good at skating switch, I normally ride regular, it's just not something I put a lot of time into.  

If you spent like 2 weeks cruising switch you would probably be good at it.  Just gotta keep using switch when you are skating after that to keep the feel in your muscle memory...

You could always learn it at a later time, I am focusing more on pop-shuvs and then kickflips / heelflips before I concentrate on stuff like riding switch and doing switch tricks.  

You could also try rolling around and doing tricks in fakie, to get comfortable with rolling with your torso faced in the other direction.  Easiest way to go into fakie is to just ride how you normally do, and do a revert.

Alternatively if you can't revert and have a nice little slope / incline, you can ride up it, and ride back down it fakie.  From there you just move your feet back a little bit and your in switch stance...

Fakie is basically switch nollie position, but it's called Fakie instead. "

Sir_Fancy_Pants,todayilearned,1389818272.0,"I would be interested in your comment on the gender ratio of World class chess champions.

there is absolutely no advantage in physical or material (funding) between players and its entirely results based (i.e not subject to interpretation as say gymnastics or figure skating is).

Truly a challenge where  gender plays no advantage or disadvantage and has been so long established it has a wide target audience who know about it (i,e isn't some niche field that only men or women would have heard about)

To save you a bit of time, the first female doesn't appear until number 55 on that list (out of a 100), obviously this is just a snap shot on Jan 2014, but if you really want you can assess the data and see that its pretty obviously male dominated by a considerable margin.

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389818324.0,"i don't think we are defining the term ""motivation"" the same way.  it sounds like you consider motivation to be a strong internal impulse to achieve goals of success.  i am describing motivation to be the internal impulse to literally do anything.  you seem to regard my definition as 'useless,' whereas i personally regard it as critical if one is to truly attempt real empathy.

By your definition one cannot be motivated to lie in bed all day.  By mine one absolutely can.  [Since human willpower is widely considered a depletable resource by the cognitive science community](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.01050.x/abstract;jsessionid=41A11D2C0CD1B148DC4A6C0B8C01DC0B.f03t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false) it makes sense to me that telling someone to ""get more motivated"" is sending them on a fool's errand.  It seems far wiser to acknowledge their existing motivations in hopes of understanding and reworking them.  The world certainly does seem to be OP's oyster, but he hasn't chosen to take it by storm yet because he hasn't been motivated to.  Why not?  What goals are his motivations serving that block his professional fulfillment?  A sense of obligation to make a certain salary?  A sense of shame about his self-actualized (fuck i hate that word) goals?

Indeed, both of our arguments seem sound enough to me when we base them off premises of our preferred definition of the term ""motivation,"" if we wanted to continue arguing about it we could split hairs over which definition is better and why.  personally i think my definition allows for a great deal more personal autonomy over one's own ability to INFLUENCE their motivations.  by your definition drive seems like something someone is just plain lucky to be born with, and while i think this is certainly true of some people (maybe you're one of them?), i don't think that's a productive way to look at our own agency when we're dissatisfied with our lives.

somehow my comment about billionaires seemed to turn this into a discussion about class privilege, which was hardly my intent.  sure institutions like class play their role, but the imbalances of opportunity that come to my mind are far more unique and personal compared to structural disadvantages like poverty.  by my view, it is unfair to view the playing field as level even between siblings raised in the same home.  in my opinion it deeply marginalizes the experiences of others to judge someone as too lazy, wherever they fall on the class spectrum.  i don't think a lack of privilege is a free pass from trying one's hardest and i don't think tremendous privilege is a free pass from huge personal struggle."

gravvs,AskMen,1389818350.0,"&gt;Behavioral causality isn't the same thing as emotion. You might want to learn that.

So you're judging people for breaking up with people who they are no longer interested in? Because that's the behavior we're talking about. We're not talking about cheating right now. We're not talking about people using others then breaking up. We're simply talking about relationships ending. Just breaking up.

&gt;You're conflating validity with honesty. 'I'm not feeling this anymore' isn't a cause. It's an effect.

That's my point. Sometimes there isn't a cause. People change. They grow. Their desires change. Things can be going seemingly perfectly in a relationship and one party might want because it isn't working for a reason that they can't identify. 

&gt;There is if the reason that you give the person you're breaking up with an explanation that is anything but ""I'm breaking up with you because I've found what I think is a better option.""

No one owes a partner an explanation for wanting to end things. They can just say it's over. When someone finds a better option it's usually a sign that things aren't working and that they should end it *regardless* of whether they end up with a new partner. But why things aren't working isn't necessarily clear. Sometimes it is just a feeling.

&gt;That is not the truth. Might there be multiple reasons? Yes. But the person knows a lot of them. Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, kiddo.

Emotion is not black and white. Emotion is not steady. People change despite themselves. Their desires change even if they don't want them to. How many people do you know that have a clear unchanging view of what they want and why they want it? Human desire is muddled and dynamic. "

that said, is it possible you are gay and have been ""suppressing it"" for years? maybe but unlikely. it's possible that you are bi. or it's possible that your sexuality is shifting slightly.

the real question is this: does it matter? you are developing feelings for him. you are having sex with him. trust your feelings, and forget about what society has been telling you about men, women, and sexuality. you are an adult. he is an adult. you are both consenting. don't worry about having to put a label on yourself.

xXCptCoolXx,MensRights,1389818482.0,"I understand where you're coming from and it helps to keep in mind that what is seen here is not typical of the average woman. Most women, like most men, are normal people who wouldn't do many of the things that put you off of potential relationships.

Here are some tips though to put your mind at ease:

- Don't engage in random hookups. If you're going to be intimate with someone make sure you know what kind of a person they are.
- Typically, the behaviours you're afraid of come from younger individuals, such as in high school or early college, and are less common the older you both are. 
- Date someone you can trust and someone who can trust you. Think of a relationship like a friendship in terms of vulnerability. I'm sure you have some friends you'd trust while you were vulnerable and some you wouldn't. Look for this in a relationship partner as well.
- If you still feel uneasy then the back-up plan would be to keep a record of texts, e-mail conversations, or anything else that could be useful if a rumour or charge was laid against you. 

It's impossible to know 100% of the time who is a good person and who isn't, but don't let your worries hold you back from being happy. Be safe and hope for the best!"

Fortunately, the nausea is temporary. For me, the worst of was over within a week. It pretty much went away entirely after about two months.

I found some ginger mints in the health food section at the grocery store. They taste AWFUL (then again, I don't like ginger), but they'll clean up your nausea really quick. Like, within ten minutes. The aftertaste is nasty, but at least it won't make you nauseated again! 

Another tip: drink a full glass of water with your meds to make sure they go all the way down. If I don't, I get a nauseated feeling along with something like heartburn. It suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks."

JordanLeDoux,PoliticalDiscussion,1389818545.0,"So we have this then:

- In the 90s your family was able to get by on about $7k, which is about $14k in today's money.
- This would be accomplished with your UBI by having this children collect as well. In fact, living on your own would be much more difficult and such a low UBI would create more 'welfare babies' than any other social program, as the costs don't scale linearly.
- You then claim that in the mid 00's (we'll call it 2005) you lived on ~$915/month (the $11k you didn't save). In today's money that's about $1,100.
- This shows how living without extra assistance cost you much more, as it's nearly three times as much as your proposed UBI.

The reason the government would be motivated to do something like this is that it:

- Doesn't play favorites or convey anyone a special advantage.
- Creates equal opportunity of financial freedom.
- [It reduces systemic spending on healthcare](http://basicincome.org.uk/interview/2013/08/health-forget-mincome-poverty/)
- It provides a better economic return than virtually any other kind of government spending.
- It creates enough liquidity in labor markets for businesses and employees to create a better match in the free market.
- It vastly reduces the strain on businesses to carry the weight of compensation, and would make the minimum wage basically obsolete, allowing companies to hire for much less where people will take much less.
- It allows individuals to take the kinds of risks that benefit a free market system.
- It reduces the externalities associated with poverty, which also saves money through things like reduced crime, better access to social services and education, more stability in life choices, etc.

Basically, the government would do it because it benefits society, the taxpayers, and the people who need assistance. If each adult 18+ or emancipated minor received $1,200 per month (approximately what you were living off of in 2005 using todays dollars), and each minor received $400, our economy, our government and our society would be better off.

It would cost the government somewhere around $2.5 trillion per year, but tax revenue would increase and the economy would grow more stably and faster."

wweezzee,loseit,1389818610.0,"So, from one of your other posts, right now we are basically the exact same as far as height and weight. 1200 is a fine goal, but if you are working out as well, you can definitely go over and still lose weight at a decent rate.  

My BMR, which should be pretty much the same as yours, as we are the same stats, is around 1600. 1600 is how many calories you burn if you just were completely lifeless and laying around all day. Add in the fact that you don't just lay around all day and that bumps it up to at least 2000 per day that you burn. Then add in your exercise through out the week, and you could be anywhere above that. 

I try to stick to 1200 too, but don't really worry about my control until I eat over 1500 for multiple days. Even then, I still lose weight. Also, I don't ever eat back my calories from exercise unless I am absolutely famished. 

Also remember it is a marathon not a sprint. Seriously, don't be discouraged tomorrow if you don't see a big drop. Know that eating an average of 1300 per day with some exercise will work- it is pretty much impossible for someone of our stats to not eventually lose the weight eating that kind of deficit."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389818670.0,"&gt; Good and bad are relative to your position when it comes to policy. The ACA, for example, is ""good"" for some, and ""bad"" for others. You cannot have a policy that benefits all.

Agreed, but I think there is something to be said about policies that produce the greatest good for the greatest number.

&gt;Then the state has already had its way with you. You have submitted mentally.

Oh give me a break. You know, most of the time, when people think liberals are mental slaves and think of themselves as oh so enlightened, they themselves are mental slaves of corporate interests.

&gt;What is the ""government"" but other humans? What are ""corporations"" but other humans? Why are they more capable than you?

Government is a bunch of people elected to serve the people and make rules for us. They also provide common good services for us at times where the private sector does a bad job.

Corporations are entities out to make products and services in return for a profit. 

&gt;Governments lie on a spectrum of how well their people prosper. I think ours has done pretty well in this regard.

It has, but it's not perfect, and quite frankly, I think it's lagging behind other countries in a lot of core areas like healthcare and education.

&gt; I just recognize all authority for what it is: monopolization of violence.

So let's sure that monopoly serves the right people. 

&gt;Because I realize that, I refuse to allow any authority to dictate to me what is ""right"" or ""wrong.""

But in our society, at least theroetically, we vote for people who are supposed to recognize our values of right and wrong. I admit, this sometimes doesnt happen and I think corporations have too much influence in policy making, but the idea is that the rule making body is ultimately responsible to us. That in making rules, it represents our interests and our concerns. That the laws favor US. Again, I admit, this doesnt always happen, especially given how much money is thrown around in politics, but honestly, I think the state, at least in a democratic form, has more positives than negatives.

incogito_ergo,DecidingToBeBetter,1389818675.0,"Bro, do you even lift? No, seriously, lifting things up and putting them down is a great way to boost mood and energy levels, as well as improving your aesthetics.

You need to break the cycle of worry, and that means you need to break your mental habits.  You don't break habits by ""stopping"", you break habits by creating new ones.  By force.  

Often worry such as yours results from fixation on factors that are beyond your control.  This is completely unproductive.  Focus on what you can control.  Give 100% to your job and to your relationship.  If you fail, so what.  You can't do any better than your best, so no regrets.  Use the failure as a learning experience and do better the next time. Focus on the things you can control, accept failure gracefully, and use it to improve.  That attitude alone will put you miles ahead of your peers, both as an employee and as a romantic partner.

Don't be afraid to fail.  Be afraid of not learning from your failures, and repeating the same mistakes time and time again."

She's not your shoulder to cry on, you're right.  But it depends on what you mean by ""cry"".

She's not going to accept your emotional outpour.  HOWEVER, she will appreciate you asking for her insight about your problems.

Here's the difference, ""I don't know why I've been so depressed my whole life.  It doesn't make sense... Why would I do something that hurts me so much?""  Said with confidence, no tears, as an inquiry to better oneself.

""I don't know why I've been so... [insert sniffles and wet eyes] depressed!  It's been like that my whole life. [said with desperation]  Why would I do something that hurts me so much? [said with a need to be comforted].""

I think the first would get a good response.  She'll feel like she's nurturing you, helping you grow, giving you insight, but you don't depend on her.  She's just a comfortable pillow for you to lay on while you think.

In the second you're clinging to her.  Handing emotional control of your Self over to her.  She's not going to like that..."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389818796.0,"Depends on the guys and their goals, though.  I think sometimes there's this stigma where if guys care about calories then they're considered to be unmanly.  Which is pretty funny, because a couple of my friends and I are pretty serious about what we eat and how much, and it's because we workout a lot and follow at least somewhat of a bodybuilding routine, so we're not exactly small dudes.

I had my buddy over for lunch recently, and when I asked him, he said, ""can you cook something healthy?""  And again, when we were talking about meeting up at a restaurant, it was ""do they have healthy options?""  I usually don't make a big deal over it, and if I'm with people that don't know how closely I keep my nutrition in check, I don't say anything, but I also don't really stray from sticking to my particular calories/macros.  It matters to me, I just usually don't want to talk about it with people that don't have similar goals.  I'm not going to say ""I'm not eating nachos because they don't fit my macros,"" I'll just pass.  Same thing regardless of gender, I'm just less vocal about why I'm passing.

And I'm not saying you aren't right or that doesn't happen, because I'm sure some people are like that, but I wouldn't say it's always the case.  It's not like eating a huge burger all the time isn't going to have a negative consequence of gaining weight, and that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to eat like crap.

And this isn't an attack, sorry if any of it comes off that way.  Just explaining the other side from someone who also is very particular about what they eat!"

You may well be depressed, but there's nothing wrong with that. We all are. You sound to me like a creative, fun person and I certainly wouldn't mind knowing you in real life. These little imaginings are a good thing; not only do they show that you have a pretty active brain, they show that you have ambition. It might not feel like it, but the next step you need to take is to sit back and think about *how* you achieve all these things you dreamt up. 

And it's all manageable, too, that's the good thing. You didn't dream up castles and yachts and private jets, you dreamt up things like a decent house and a nice girl. If I were you, I'd go out and apply for every fucking job you can find, and accept whatever comes back. You may hate it, but it's only temporary - just something to get your foot on the employment ladder. Before you know it you'll have all these things you want, don't worry.

Vooxie,personalfinance,1389818919.0,"&gt; They can give you the money by matching or they can just give you the money in your paycheck.

I think this is something a lot of people miss when looking at employee benefits.  
  
I once had a job that broke down my compensation at the end of the year. My compensation included my salary, but then it included how much they contributed to my healthcare, dental, 401(k), etc.  
  
I thought, sneaky bastards! Look at them making it seem like they're paying me $10K more than they actually are! But they were. They just paid me the money through benefits rather than paychecks/cash.  
  
Now, I personally would rather have a significantly larger salary to cover dental, health insurance, 401(k) matching, etc. so then I can make the decisions of how my money is spent. But other people look for benefits to not deal with the hassle. Or maybe it's a comfort thing. I don't know. The point is: Whether an employer matches your 401(k) (unless as /u/arsenic87 mentioned, you max it out... because then the amount contributed can be over $17500, etc, etc, etc.) is irrelevant. People should look at the total compensation (this includes the value of benefits).   
  
Say my employer matches $5000/year. Whether or not they match my 401(k) contribution or just give me a $5000 raise that I can just throw into my 401(k) doesn't matter to me. It's the same amount of money that the employer is giving me.

Brightt,LucidDreaming,1389819019.0,"As a natural myself, I'll answer some of these. Natural as in: I have amazing dream recall without even doing effort, it just comes naturally. I go lucid pretty often, although it used to be more in the past. I'm down to about once/week, it used to be 2-3 times/week. But I'm cranking it up again. Last night I was lucid almost all night.

&gt; Do you lose yourself in daily activities like driving, reading, working, etc? I ask in the sense that perhaps you don't lose yourself and are ""aware"" of your ""self"" all day long. Not necessarily of things around you, but of yourself.

I don't really know what you mean by this...

&gt; What is your diet? Lots of carbs, none, veggies ? Soda ?

I don't watch my diet, I just eat stuff :)

&gt; Do you remember the dreams where you weren't lucid ?

Yep, almost all of them, and sometimes even years later. I often have flashbacks to dreams I had years earlier. Which is a weird sensation, but I love it.

&gt; If you do not write your dreams somewhere, do you tend to remember them anyway ?

It depends, if I don't actively remember them when I wake up, I tend to forget them short-term wise, but they'll always be stored away somewhere, since I get flashbacks pretty often. If I write them down, I'll remember them in amazing detail as if they were actual events I witnessed. If I read my dream journal from a year ago, I'll remember everything that happened in those dreams even though I only wrote down 3 or 4 words describing a scene.

&gt; How is your memory overall ?

I have great memory when it comes to events, but I'll forget appointments or stuff like that pretty much always.

&gt; When you close your eyes and try to picture something, how is the quality of the picture ? Are you able to project into ""normal"" vision or like me you can only see a very faded image with your ""minds eye""?

I can only see faded images.

&gt; Do you recall the position your eyes tend to go while sleeping ? When waking up from bad nights with no dream recall I tend to find myself looking down, for example.

I never bothered thinking about this. I don't think it matters.

&gt; Do you always get lucid on the spot, inside the dream ? Almost every one of the few times I did get lucid I was entering the dream after a quick awakening, and went though the ear's ripping and body sensations/etc..

I usually only get lucid inside a dream. Sometimes I'll even be lucid and not know it. As in, I'll start altering my dream (usually in the form of granting myself superpowers) without actually realizing I'm dreaming. I also hardly ever use reality checks to become lucid, it's usually just a matter of circumstances. I'll realize something is odd, and that's when I'll become lucid.

&gt; When you wake up, do you have memories of going to sleep ? Like, that phase between awake and sleeping. I just blank out, forgetting what I was thinking just before falling asleep.

Very, very rarely.

&gt; Do you wake up naturally in the middle of the night, just to go to sleep again ?

Yes, I'll often wake up, look around, close my eyes and reenter the dream I just left.

&gt; Do you have any history of recurring nightmares ? Also, do you get lucid in them too ?

Yes and yes, sometimes. I love nightmares though. Especially if I wake up full blown panicked and my SO is lying next to me, trying to calm me down. She'll usually spoon me and I'll fall back to sleep immediately. I never have trouble falling back to sleep after nightmares, and once I realize it was a nightmare (be it while asleep or when I woke up), all the panic will usually go away.

&gt; If you take aids to sleep (describe what kind if you did and if possible): do LD's or even recall still happen ?

No, and I actually have a really hard time falling asleep. I'll usually lie awake for at least an hour, and sometimes a lot longer.

&gt; Does it happen if you sleep outside your bed/home ?

It happens everywhere for me. But I feel comfortable sleeping anywhere really, so it might have to do with that.

&gt; When sick (like, cold/fever) does it still happen ?

Yes.

&gt; Have you observed something to help or trouble your lucid dreaming ? Like dietary changes, life changes, more or less sleep, etc..

Don't go to sleep high. I have a really hard time getting lucid and sometimes even simple dream recall if I went to bed high. I can still become lucid/recall when I go to be drunk, but it's also less common. I sleep like a fucking rock though when I go to bed drunk.

&gt; Do you have any tendency to see but not see things ? Like missing car keys right in front of you.

Not noticeably. I'm sure everyone has it sometimes, but it's not like it's problematic.

&gt; How is your time dependent memory, like ""I need to remind X in 3 hours"" ?

I have a really accurate internal clock if that's what you mean? I can usually tell within a pretty small range how much time has past. I can also tell the time using the sun to usually about 15min accuracy, but that's different.

&gt; Does alcohol influence your ability to lucid dream ?

It kind of helps when I go to bed slightly tipsy, because I'll sleep deeper and fall asleep faster, but if I'm really drunk it will have a slightly negative effect, but it won't rid me of my 'abilities' completely.

&gt; Do you have a tendency of not recalling someone you haven't seen in a long time, after/while you are seeing them again ?

Don't really understand what you mean by this. If you mean ""do you have dreams about people you haven't seen in a long time"", the answer is yes. Sometimes, people I haven't seen for over a decade will be in my dreams. If you mean ""do you not remember who they are"", that's kind of hard to tell, since I won't know a difference between someone I used to know but don't remember and a random dream character.

&gt; How is your geospatial memory ? Mine sucks. I live in the same city for 20+ years and it's not too hard for me to get lost. Imagining the car route to somewhere is very hard for me.

Insane. Like, over the top accurate. I'll remember any road or route I've ever used to get anywhere, even if it was only once. I can find my way to places even when I go to places for the first time.

Example: we went to South Africa this summer, it was the first time I ever visited Cape Town. A friend of mine asked me what street a certain shop was we had been to, because his dad was going back, and he wanted to buy something there. I loaded up a map of Cape Town and pointed to the street immediately. He asked me if I was sure. So we actually googled the store (something we should have done first), and it was the right street.

&gt; Do you read fantasy books, and if so, when you imagine the scenarios you are reading about, does it seem very real ? Everything I imagine while awake is very ""fadey"".

I do, I love fantasy. Yes, actually, if I read, I'll usually envision the scenes very lively in my head, although not 100% of the time, but often enough."

Dsf192,TruePokemon,1389819024.0,"Ditto is in it's own Egg group.  The Ditto Egg group cannot breed with either Ditto or the Undiscovered egg group.

&gt;A common question is what will hatch from the egg? The egg will contain the lowest form of the ***female Pokémon's evolution*** change, barring any pre-evolutions added after the Pokémon was first created. There are several exceptions to this however. The Pokémon Nidoran ♂ &amp; Volbeat are always male while Nidoran ♀ &amp; Illumise are always female. Despite this and them being different species, the egg that the Nidoran ♀ and Illumise hatch will have a 50% chance of being Nidoran ♂ and Volbeat respectively and a 50% chance of being the same as the mother. In addition to this, some genderless Pokémon can also breed. While they're included in various egg groups, they can only breed with Ditto and so the Pokémon will be the base evolution of the genderless Pokémon.

[Source](http://www.serebii.net/games/breed.shtml).

Ditto replicates the female of a species (hence the move ""transform"") if it's with a male, and this is why you get Pokemon of the same species.  [There are no female Tauros, Braivary/Rufflet, any of the Hitmon-trio species, and a few other species of Pokemon](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_gender_ratio#Male_only).  Thus you can never get an egg of that species without breeding them with Ditto.  The Ditto steps in and acts as a female of said species.

It's not that complicated."

If we removed the USA from today's equation, there would now be new world powers a step below us. They'd be the new world leaders. If you remove them, then again, there are even more people, and now these people will be the new world powers. There obviously are always going to be world powers, but what is important is how many.

When there isn't one power keeping order, other states start making power grabs. When no one can tell them ""no, we wont let you do that,"" states will do what states do, and that's to seek out favorable interests for themselves. Naturally this creates conflict. So what do states start doing? They start forming stronger alliances, while others do the same, all to protect their interests. Eventually, war is going to break out until someone rises to the top as the new world leader.

Look back at history at any point where there was no single world hegemony. WWI and II are obvious, before that it was before Napoleon, or before that, the Ottoman Empire, or before that Alexander. 

The point is, whenever there isn't a clear world power, eventually someone will slowly start gaining more and more power until they have turned the table into their favor and now they can rapidly begin expanding and gaining a hegemony status.  "

hopewings,relationships,1389819171.0,"I am sorry to hear that you are struggling with this.  I have read through your comments, and I think you need to have a real heart-to-heart talk with your boyfriend.  You can ask strangers online about this, but in the end, BOTH of you need to make this decision together.  

You also both need to be FULLY informed.  Educate yourself, and don't think of a child as a ""life-ruining"" thing automatically.  However, having a child is a scary thing even for those of us who went into it with both partners 100% wanting the baby.  I also won't sugarcoat reality.  It is very hard when the baby is young, even with a supportive husband, family members, and having a generally good and stable life.

You have written:

&gt;He's terrified that we are not financially stable and doesn't understand why I just can't wait a few more years. He just started his career and while he doesn't make THAT much, we make enough to support a baby.

Is this his only fear?  That a baby is expensive, and you should wait a few more years to be more financially stable?  That is not as bad as if he said, ""I refuse to ever have a baby with you.""  You can assuage his fears with facts, i.e. breakdown the cost of daycare, diapers, food, and other expenses.  We have a 16-month-old, and it is really not very expensive outside of daycare, as we don't buy a lot of expensive things, and babies don't need much.

His thoughts are for abortion right now, but he needs to realize that this is also HIS child.  Generally speaking, men are not very connected with babies until they are born, and even then, not very much until after the kids are a little older.  A lot of the male connection is via the female, so generally when the man really loves the woman, he will stay around to take care of her through her pregnancy.  Does your boyfriend truly love you for the long haul?  If he would want to have kids with you down the road, then having them now is not the end of the world.

However, it is natural to feel conflicting emotions about having a baby that is not 100% wanted by the father.  Having gone through several pregnancy losses, I can tell you that a positive pregnancy test is not a ""sure thing"" either.  It is perfectly okay to feel like you would prefer to not have the baby.   It is also perfectly okay to wish for the best possible outcome, that is, you have a healthy baby, your boyfriend falls in love with the baby once he meets him or her, and you raise the baby together.

I would encourage you to talk honestly and openly with your boyfriend, tell him your hopes and fears, tell him what you have told us, and ask him for his true feelings regarding the baby.  Now is the time for communication to be wide open, and for you both to really do some soul-searching about yourselves and your plans for the future.

Take care, and I'm here to talk if you would like."

maxwell_smart_jr,statistics,1389819181.0,"When you ask about ""bias"", I take that as something that would systematically lead to an over-estimate or under-estimate of the effect size.  In your hypothetical case, whether there is bias really depends on other factors.  If the treatment in your example is completely ineffective, then the experiment will not biased in favor of observing an effect where there is not one.

If your specific set of assumptions is that the treatment is effective, but is not completed by everybody, you can report the effect size from only those who completed the treatment according to some pass/fail cutoff (ie, attended 9/10 training sessions) as long as you say that, or you could report the effect size across every person who initiated training, as long as you specify that as well.

It would be a mistake to treat the effect size of those who completed training as what you could expect from the typical person who starts training, but may or may not complete it. 

As a concrete example, you will see that condoms are over 99% effective for preventing pregnancy for ""perfect use"", and significantly less so for ""typical use"".  There are two sets of figures that are used and quoted, and each makes a different set of assumptions about effectiveness where one applies to all people, and the other applies to people who follow directions all the time."

As for the motivation, that's not your responsibility. Also, and I can only speak for myself here, the time after a big breakup (after the initial tears are shed, etc) is usually one of my most motivated periods. I usually get in much better shape and start focusing with more laser intensity on exactly what I want. Yes, if you looked at me for the first week or two after a breakup, I'd look a little pathetic. Get past that, and suddenly I'm on fire. So just keep that in mind.

If I were in your situation, if I wanted to break up from a long distance relationship, I would handle it thus:

Before your next trip up  there, when you call or talk to him, tell him that the next time you're up there, you need to talk. He's going to know exactly what this means and may ask ""About what?"", but just say that you'll tell him when you get there. With this, both parties pretty much know that a break up is coming (94% probability or some such), so both can prepare mentally for it. Not only does this make sure that you go through with it, but it's a good way of handling things with the distance involved.

Once you get there in person, do the break up. Make sure you state the reasons clearly behind it, then let him ask questions. After that, say your goodbyes, but also let him know that if he has any other questions, just let you know and you would be happy to answer them (this takes care of any lingering questions that may arise that weren't thought of in the heat of the moment).

Yes, if you do it, it will hurt. There will be crying, blame, and guilt. You can't really get around those. But as hard as it is, what you build up in your mind will inevitably be worse. Good luck with everything."

It's crazy. The main character is a Mary Sue, but in a way where it makes the reader consider what the term means, because it's not like she'd be anywhere close to perfect to the average reader.

There are some things Rand does really well. It's incredibly top-notch world-building. She's built, from the ground up, a world where objectivism is the rational philosophy. It's deeply flawed in the real world, but in the Atlas Shrugged universe, it actually is the logical solution. It's a world where anyone can pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, being born into money isn't any kind of advantage, the people who don't want an anarcho-capitalist/minarchist society really are lazy/crazy/insane. The entire planet has been reimagined. Society took a weird left turn at some point. It's alternate reality fiction.

It's also hands-down the most confident book I've ever read, which I really enjoy. Rand was completely unwavering in writing this manifesto and at no point did she second guess herself. She didn't get five hundred pages into the book and think, ""wait a second! This is silly!"" I don't agree with her philosophy at all, but it's amazing to see someone write so confidently. She doesn't hedge anything, she doesn't make compromises, she had a vision and wrote it and at no point gave any indication that she'd considered the idea that she wasn't writing the most important book in history. As a writer, it's inspiring to see someone go so fucking balls-to-the-wall go-big-or-go-home. It's half-cocked, but it's not half-assed.

The most important reason I enjoy the book, and why a lot of people seem to hate it, is because I don't think it's necessary to agree with a book or the author to like a book. Just because it fails at it's goal to convert me to objectivism doesn't mean I can't get behind an epic about a group of people fighting for what they believe. It's people in a fictional sci-fi world fighting for ideals that make sense within their fictional culture.

If I ever taught a high-school level lit course, I'd probably use it (or at least excerpts, because it's too fucking long to ask kids to read) as a teaching aid. It's so incredibly transparent that it's easy to see a lot of techniques that are too seamless in better books, and there are enough ""what didn't you like"" elements that it would be great for classroom discussion. Learning what not to do can be just as important. It's Symbolism for Dummies, and it's the kind of intro that I think would better serve beginners instead of the complex, multi-layered works that are usually taught at that level. The themes are very explicitly stated throughout. The character development is all very direct. Everything is so simple and clearly stated that I think it would do well as a young adult book if it weren't for the fact that teenagers are obnoxious and self-absorbed enough as is."

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389819227.0,"Yes I'm fine with jumping ship from Omnipotence456's discussion.

First off, would you agree that morals are dependent on social, rational (for the most part) entities. Morals do not apply to insects, rocks or planets. Going from this premise, then morals necessarily have to involve societies of some kind, even if it's just two people. So the morals are normative in the sense of societal prescriptions for what someone ought to do to function *within*  a society, but do not go beyond that.

Second, morals are highly personal things. I don't approach the topic of abortion as viscerally as a fundamental Christian might, and we both have equally valid points about either side of the debate. So, one that has conviction that their moral code is one worth following would be motivated to either enact change through the proper political channels (or perhaps violent ones if that's what they think is moral), or move to a society that is more conducive to their moral compass.

I stay in the United States because I am comfortable with the majority of the laws, which consequently are guided by personal moral codes that aggregate to form legal policies. Some of these are not in line with what I believe are morally good and morally wrong actions, but this is based off of my own subjective experience. I want to be a part of this society, so I stay and try to change it in the socially agreed upon ways that are provided to me."

Over time, I have expanded, by finding Fauna, Flora, and Chadder. Because I think their appearance is cute, or like a pun, I become invested into talking to and trying to get their pictures.

Next, I am REALLY into cataloging. I make sure to shop at each store everyday and I like to try and change my whole appearance daily. It's just an added boost to peak my interest. I also love collecting things for the museum, mostly because my long term goal it to get all gold badges. I did this by just fishing and catching bugs, whenever I felt it was fun, not a chore. 

Lastly, keeping my home and town in tip top shape. I start everyday by running around the town, picking weeds, digging up fossils, picking the perfect trees (over 200,) and watering my flowerbeds (over 150.) Honestly, I find a lot of interest in doing all of this, it may be grinding, but I get this feeling of happiness when everything is perfect and in it's place.

kakersdozen,videos,1389819477.0,"From what I recall from my linguistics classes, yes. American English is notorious for it's use of rhotic sounds. There are other languages that say the ""American R,"" so we are not the only ones, but American is likely the most common/recognizable. Because we have the most ""R"" sounds, we have the most problems with it. Other languages have their own impediments. For example, the Spanish ""rr"" is called a trill (the long, drawn out ""rolling your r""). Many little kids cannot properly make this sound, so they don't. You might not notice it though, if you are not a native speaker.

Think of a British accent (yes, I know there are many, but go with the first one that pops in your head). Say, ""park the car."" It probably sounds like ""pawhk the caw,"" or you might omit it entirely. Now say the same phrase in American. The [American ""r""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_approximant) sounds are hard r's, very distinct. [In French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvular_trill), the letter R is very throaty, almost like you're hocking a loogie. [In Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_tap), it is ""rolled.""

The American R is actually very hard to pronounce, so if you do it the way it is done in the standard American accent, congratulations! It is very hard to learn for non-native speakers.

If you are interested in learning more, check out some [IPA charts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). They are very useful for learning how to properly pronounce words in other languages, and for explaining sounds via the interwebs."

You're going to have to spend a little bit more than $120 to play in tournaments. Used Axes can be had for the mid $200s, look for them on PBN.

Your problem is that you see yourself as the main character in a world of people who are just as complicated, and who think just as much as you do. You need to make yourself feel special, so you come up with these arbitrary metrics that unfailingly place you on the side of the good. Sure, *you'd* be happy if we handed the reins to you, but if it was somebody else you'd be protesting unfairness. What determines who has the objective viewpoint on what's good and what's bad?

Both companies, though, have to make a buck at the end of the day, and have started charging small amounts and additionally folding in premium offerings.

Congress has ""tried"" to address the issue (a really weak effort) with the [Higher Education Opportunity Act](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html).  Among other things, it tries to ensure textbook publishers give professors notice of the material changes to editions (to avoid needless changes), and for students to be made aware of their options well in advance.  From my seat, it appears that these provisions have been largely ignored.

The crux of the issue is the oligopolist nature of the textbook publishing industry.  You've got a couple big players that are loathe to shake it up, as they're making a killing and quite like it that way.  To the extent they're ""innovating,"" it's by forcing one-time use online access codes to destroy the potential of an efficient aftermarket.

If you think about it, the government is spending millions of dollars a year subsidizing the cost of textbooks through supplementary financial aid (either directly to students, or through their federal programs with the schools themselves).  If that funding were funneled into an effort to standardize learning material in an innovative and low-cost platform, we'd really be getting somewhere.

They found that most people didn't stay home or change their employment habits. The two exceptions were:

- Teens were more likely to seek out additional education instead of enter the workforce early.
- Pregnant women took more maternity leave from the workforce.

Other than that, it didn't change the 'laziness' factor at all. And honestly, I don't really think of this idea as socialist. So many of its benefits are rooted in the free market."

So one day my mum drops me off there and it's this woman who always smells like piss and has a little bit of a beard.

I keep away from her (as usual) and just mind my own business, playing with my friends, when a mother walks in and beardy piss lady comes to show her around. They come to where I am and beardy piss lady points at me and says ""She's a little bitch that one"". Completely out of the blue, I have absolutely no idea why she said it and will never find out because she died around 10 years ago I guess. But that day I went home and cried while telling my mum.

She called the Pastor and told him, who then apparently talked to beardy piss lady and said that she apologizes for saying that. She never apologized to me, just to the pastor. This whole situation pissed me off for so many years."

Perhaps this is the way the new generation of teenagers thinks but for the longest time facebook(and previously myspace) was all about amassing friends and connecting with as many people as possible.  ""OMG 100 ppl said hppy b-day to me!!!111"" and the like.  Conversations became public and less intimate. Invites and sharing information between friends went from small group conversations or one on one conversations where a person with news would call up friends or e-mail individuals to tell them the good news to not even seeking individuals at all and expecting them to check in on you at regular intervals for updates about your life.  

Maybe we're seeing the opposite of that trend now.  People want to be more connected on an individual basis rather than at such a superficial level."

KeanuReavers,LosAngeles,1389819679.0,"Not LAPD, but LA County Sheriff.

About 7 years ago, I was delivering pizzas in my car when a drunk driver t-boned me while I was at a stop sign. He didn't quite make his right hand turn and oversteered into my driver side door at 10-15 mph. Instead of reversing, he stepped on the gas and freed his vehicle by force. I followed him back to his house while calling the police to report a hit and run by a drunk driver. They told me not to follow him, and that they wouldn't be coming to the scene. They told me I could fill out a police report, but it was likely they couldn't do anything about it since an officer didn't see it happen.

I was too young, stupid, and gullible to argue otherwise and filled out a police report. Nothing ever came of it.

In hindsight, I should have looked into it more. I should have taken pictures of the damage and the house of the guy who hit me. I should have gotten the badge number of the cop who told me on the phone that doing his job wasn't really something they do.

I figured this was a good time to do it with nobody around to see me finally solve this stupid mystery.  So I get inside and I'm kind of scrunched in there.  Well the goddamn door shuts on me.  I'm trying to use my fingers to open the latch from the inside, but no dice.

She ended up yelling at him probably more than even I would have.  We talked, and we split up.  It took me awhile to move on from that one, as we had grown up being pretty close and had the same circle of friends.

The second guy I started seeing (about  1.5 years later) cheated on me about 4 months in.  I only found out when he told me (he felt guilty).  I broke up with him, probably much because of what happened with the last bf, though he wanted to try to work things out.

For both I kept together pretty well and turned my focus elsewhere (school/hobbies/work).  I'm not an angry person or really even able to hold grudges very well.

An orgasm for a woman can be a much more personal thing, so to orgasm with you requires a lot of trust.  Ask her if she can orgasm alone.  If she can, you just need to help her relax.  Once she achieves orgasm with you present it will become easier for her in the future.  
I'm sure you're saying, well she does trust me, and she does but for some women letting go completely is really tough.  
Give her a massage and then go very slowly.  Kiss her outer labia while your hands rub her thighs or her breasts.  After a few minutes of that use your tongue to part her lips.  Find her clit and gently lick it.  Pause from licking and insert your index finger with your palm up.  Make the ""come hither"" gesture, again slowly and gently.  Listen to her moans or comments and respond accordingly.  After a minute or two with just the finger begin licking the clit again while fingering.  
Listen to her.  If you hear or sense pleasure, keep doing exactly what you are doing.  Don't go faster or harder, unless she says faster or harder.  ""Don't stop"" usually means, keep doing exactly what you are doing right then.  
Tell her how awesome she is.  Sexy, beautiful, amazing, etc.  Talk gently about how good it feels to touch her like that and how good her body feels in your hands.

That's why I hooked up the chest with hoppers to keep the dispensers full. :)

&gt;So even if you don't have any signal in output of the AND gate, your clock is still running. Isn't it laggy ?

No, the signal dies if you're not standing on the pressure plate. When the signal re-enters the AND gate and you're not keeping the other side of the AND gate on, then when the signal pulse feeds back into the gate, nothing will come out and the loop dies.

&gt;What is the period of you clock ? Because when fully optimized (one cycle = 4 ticks) you would reach 30 000 flowers per hour :P

I didn't use a separate clock. The signal pulse passes through the different components (dispenser1, pistons1, dispenser2, pistons2, AND gate) in order, with delayed repeaters between each. That way the dispenser only fires once per grass position. It also means everything isn't constantly firing (like it looks like yours does), so there's less lag overall.

I haven't tested the production speed of mine. When I have some time I'll see how fast it can go."

If you look at the bridge in the background of the photo, you can barely see a more modern bridge (no truss structure, looks like your typical highway bridge) behind it. Under this bridge is a little dive bar whose exterior was used as the outside of the bar featured in the movie.

Lots of scenes from the movie are from this general area."

We are creatures that shouldn’t exist under natural law… The honorable thing for our species to do is to stop reproducing and walk hand in hand, brothers and sisters, into extinction — one last midnight.”

animuseternal,Buddhism,1389820107.0,"On realms:

Keep in mind that animals exist *two realms* below the human realm. We are capable of perceiving them and they us, though to a limited degree. So realms are concurrent planes of existence, basically ""superimposed"" over one another (there's no clear distinction), with some limited ability to perceive beings across other realms.

In Vietnamese culture, hungry ghosts are a very real conception that affect every day life. In other cultures, we might call them ""ghosts."" You can choose to believe or not believe, but in my own experience and what I have gleaned through meditation ... it all makes a lot of sense to me.

The same with devas. A higher realm, mostly outside of our ability to perceive. But, on occasion, there are glimpses. I think the concept of angelic/divine intervention came from glimpses of the higher realms. The Islamic concept of *djinn* reminds me a lot of the Buddhist devas too.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter. Practice how you practice. You can decide on these other matters later. You can decide right now if you want. Just don't cling to dogma or concepts. Do not cling to being right or being wrong. That's the important thing."

The main reason this happens is because there are 44 million MORE men than women in India. India also has a large amount of young people. Because there are so many men, there is a lot of pent up sexual tension for men. This tension combined with women becoming increasingly independent in a patriarchal society (not something their culture wants to see) leads to this gang rape."

I would recommend swapping out the Murad for a BHA topical, like the Stridex pads. That will help you keep more of that active ingredient on your skin, since with a wash the time it is in contact with your skin is very short. Just make sure you do this slowly, so that you don't end up overdrying your skin.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389820405.0,"These tribunals are a joke. My buddy back in college actually ended up going back home overseas because he couldn't take how ridiculous the system was, including how uptight ""follow the law by the letter, not the spirit"" type people are here. 

Basically, there was an RA that hated him vehemently. We never did anything against him, he just didn't like us. I assume it was because we were the frat type that would always have people over in his room while we drank, messed with women, and had a good time -- all within the school guidelines. No rules were ever broken. And frankly, we weren't trying to be dicks. If someone asked us to keep it down, we would. It's not like we were throwing huge parties; it was usually just 5 or so guys playing games, drinking, listening to music and smoking out on the patio. No one had a problem with us except that fucking RA, even the other RAs liked us and would hangout from time to time.

But he still just held a grudge against us. MULTIPLE times he'd enforce a room search because he suspected marijuana. A good handful of these times they included police searches. Not a single time was a single prohibited substance discovered. It was getting ridiculous. This guy would just make up that he smelled weed so he had an excuse to search us. Fucking little prick just loved abusing his power. I bet he's a cop now.

Anyways, eventually one day we are all in his room, not even drinking ready to go out to some party down the street. Then here comes little Napoleon knocking on the door telling us to keep the music down. Mind you, it's 8 and it's in our full right to have it as loud as possible. But we didn't want to cause a scene so we obliged and turned it down. But the truth is, he wasn't really here about the music, he was just hoping he could get the door open and find us partying so he could bust us with something.

But there was nothing. We weren't doing shit other than listening to music and bullshitting before we went out. But the fucker looks into the room and asks to see what's in the trash. It had a good 4 empty beer bottles from the night before. But we soon discovered that empty bottles implied drinking was occurring and since one person in the room was underage, that means we were all contributing to his delinquencies. WTF? Yeah, that happened.

So we are just all pissed, but who fucking cares. Move on with our lives. Even though there is no proof we were drinking, the school is retarded and those are the dumbass rules. So we go out and party and come back at around 1 am. 

Maybe 5 minutes after getting back to his room, we get a knock on the door. It's the little fucker again saying he smells weed, and has cops with him to search the room. (I'm telling you, this RA is just like an asshole cop. He just keeps pressing and pressing because he knows eventually you'll slip. I imagine he chose this time after the party because he'd assume my buddy would most likely have weed on him.)

Cops search, find nothing. During the discussion with the cops my buddy knew his legal rights and admitted, yeah I smoked pot sometime today, like 4 hours ago off campus at someone elses house. I'm not even high any more.

BOOM! I hear the little fucker walk out of the room telling his RA friend, ""I got him! I finally got him! I knew it would happen eventually! I got him!""

So, we later found out in the tribunal that you aren't even allowed to be high on campus. Because being high on campus implies that you may have had drugs on campus. Even though there was no evidence, and he wasn't even high anymore, they charged him with having pot on campus. 

This lead to him getting a 7 day eviction notice from the dorms, and placed under academic probation. 

He said fuck that, dropped his classes, and moved back to London. "

That said, he has no right to take away your choice. Just as you have no right to take away his. The first thing you need to do - and immediately - is get a lawyer specializing in family law. Offer him a get out now card. He can sign away his rights and never have to deal with it. That way he isn't a father, and you don't have an abortion. You can add in a clause about revisiting this arrangement in 5, 10, or however many years. Or, if he wants to be in his child's life he can choose that. You can have primary custody. He can visit until he's ready for more. Whatever you decide - get it in writing from a lawyer. 

""He's terrified that we are not financially stable"" - who is when they first have a kid? Don't get me wrong. I'm waiting until we are more stable, but if it happened now... it's not like you're completely destitute with no way to support yourselves much less a child. 

He ""doesn't understand why I just can't wait a few more years"" - because you're pregnant now. I'm also incredibly pro-choice. But I think if you are capable of supporting your child, if you want your child, you should have your child unless you have an incredibly good reason not to. ""He wants to enjoy his 20s"" isn't a good enough reason. 

There's no reason you shouldn't be able to support this child. No, it isn't ideal, but I don't think it's extreme enough to warrant completely getting rid of it if you don't want to. He has plenty of options here. Just protect yourself and your child - in writing. "

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389820596.0,"&gt; Cool. So, let's go ahead and enslave all black people (10% of the population), to benefit everyone else, right? If you could do this and eliminate all disease, war, and suffering of 90% of the population, would you?

Strawman much? I don't believe the best good simply involves actions, it also involves rights. However, unlike libertarians, I don't treat property rights as a sacred cow because they can be extremely harmful to everyone else. I get the life and liberty part, but to truly enjoy liberty, you sometimes need rules...that's the point of government...to make rules to make our lives better and more pleasurable. Property rights, the third pillar of libertarianism...is tricky. I respect it, but only to an extent. I think they're more malleable, and I think the state is fully within its right to tax people and provide services for them when the private sector does a bad job. 

Even though I'm a utilitarian, I recognize ""pure"" utilitarianism isn't always for the greater good, and I believe the concept of rights works into that greater good. I also accept aristotle's theory of the mean, where you should accept everything in some form of moderation. Although that moderation can vary, since i also apply the rule to the rule. Point is, to me, if you wanna maximize freedom, you have to limit property rights. I knwo this sounds kinda foggy and inconsistent, but that's because the world is a complicated place.

&gt;I am part of a ""corporation.""

&gt;Corporations are, as you point out, just organizations of people out to provide a service or create a good and gain some form of return.

&gt;Tell me, how am I enslaved? I compete and win, or lose. I ask for nothing from anyone unless I am willing to provide them with some benefit of their own (i.e. that service which I provide.)

Because you cant exactly get through life not dealing with corporations, so to a degree they should have restrictions and obligations on them.

&gt;As stated before, we lead in healthcare where it matters: technological investment. And, our universities are the envy of the world.

50 million people without health insurance. Even more people who can still be bankrupted due to a medical emergency. Libertarians love to talk about these isolated economic/technological achievements that don't benefit anyone because they're too expensive to afford.

&gt;And how do you propose to do that?

Voting, organizing, and using government to establish rules beneficial to all.

&gt;You think that somehow by increasing the power of one part of that marriage over your agency is going to make your life better?

Actually, way to strawman a position that I havent even fully explained. Because I actually have NUANCED views on stuff. I would love to see rules that limit corporate involvement. While I believe they have a say, they have a disproportionate say because they're given the ""freedom"" to inundate the system with campaign contributions and the like. I'd like to fix that. Quite frankly, if they only represent 10% of the population, they should only have 10% of the say."

This might sound harsh, but here it goes ... open your legs WIDE! 

The thing with my Asian woman was this:  I had to power her legs open in order to penetrate.  Once opened, she took most of it (I was too long and bottoming out about 3/4 the way in).  It did take her a while to get used to my cock - but she was a trooper.  The other side of the equation was me being gentle and not pounding her pussy right away. 

Also, a woman with Vaginismus.  Her pussy was REALLY REALLY tight.  It took 15-20min JUST to fully penetrate her.  But she took it all.  Slow, gentle, but deliberate thrusting and I was fully inside of her.  

You CAN take it!  Relax.  Take some deep breaths.  Open your legs wide and take it.  If you continue with the thinking that it will be painful then it WILL be painful.  Your pussy is muscular so it can stretch to unthinkable widths.  Again, relax.  You can take it.  Trust me.  "

For instance I could do without seeing most of my extended family, including my step-sister, for the rest of my life. 

I'll attend my grandmother's funeral, maybe one of my aunts, but the rest can go to hell. I never knew them growing up, they never cared or spoke to me, gifted me or acted like they wanted anything to do with me. Numerous times after being back around my extended family I've reached out to spend time with them, get to know them, but their interest wasn't even a smidge of the interest I had in becoming acquainted with my own blood relatives.

My ""Family"" is my parents, and my little nephew. One day I'll get that kid out of his selfish, terrible mother's home and show him a good life."

Buttah,femalefashionadvice,1389820792.0,"I generally purchase work wear from: Ann Taylor, Anthropologie, GAP/Banana Republic, Nordstrom &amp; Nordstrom Rack and Target. 

I am a sale stalker. My strategy is to never pay full price for anything, and to gauge how often I will wear something before deciding on which quality to go for. For a pair of pants that will see heavy wear, spend a little more. For a cardigan that goes over a dress I might wear once a month, spend a lot less.

If you wash your clothes on delicate or handwash and use a lighter detergent (I use Eucalan on my delicates and Charlie's Soap for everything else) and NEVER dry them, they can last a long time.

Also, a lot of people have mentioned this around the sub, but tailoring your clothes can help them look more expensive as they will fit you better. It's also generally cheaper than purchasing high quality office wear.

OH! And one last thing. I have a GAP silver card and I get free basic alterations on BR purchases, rewards, free shipping and further discounts on sales, etc. I recommend looking into it if you like their clothes."

Slukaj,todayilearned,1389820837.0,"Actually that isn't the case. Up until these cells were harvested, scientists had been unable to produce a line of human cells that could grow in cultures. They'd been trying for a *very* long time, and the scientists at John-Hopkins were attempting to do just this. HeLa just happened to be the first, and so far only, cells we found that could do this.

The reason HeLa cells have been so important is because they're cancer cells; the instructions that limit a cell's life-span were missing from the cells taken from her. This lack of self-termination instructions allow the cells to grow indefinitely as long as they've got the appropriate resources available.

To my knowledge, there has only been one other set of cells that do remotely what HeLa does, called WI-38. However, WI-38 cells aren't cancer cells like HeLa.

And no, it's from every country. Have you ever read about the demographic transition model? Have you looked at population statistics lately, through time?

Basically it's as simple as: death rates fell faster than birth rates did, but birth rates are continuing to fall, even as death rates are leveling off. Hence, population stability as seen in the pre-modern period is on the horizon.

No one ever said we don't have to do anything. We are all part of this process through our individual actions. Continuing to provide birth control, fighting sexist oppression, working for social and economic justice, caring for our environment... all of these are things that we must continue to do for the whole project to work.

I think terms like a Gay Muslim or Christian are contradictory. I think it's fine to follow the teachings while also being gay but then you aren't still a Muslim/Christian.

(Well I think technically lesbians are okay according to the bible as they aren't specifically mentioned)

I have nothing against nice Christians (or any other religion, I'm just using it as an example) as long as they admit that when they're best friends with an atheist that they aren't really supposed to be accepting of that. Sure 'love thy neighbour' and all that but according to you he's still going to hell. You can claim that you're friends to try and convert him but if you aren't actually doing that then you're just lying to yourself and in a sense to God too.

I understand it depends on how closely you follow the wording of the bible. I suppose my opinion is more you're either religious or you aren't and you can't just pick the bits you want to follow. Some fundamental Christians may annoy me but at least they're following exactly what's in their book. I don't think you can sit on the fence with it and claim agnosticism or trying to be politically correct. Religion isn't politically correct.

They don't look for alternative sources, they don't try to find problems in the story, they don't think of what circumstances could have led up to the story, they don't look for opinions from those who dissent... they just gobble up the story at face value and believe it word for word. The media may bring cherry-picked, biased, and sometimes warped or modified news features or entertainment shows into the eye of the public, but select members of the public are to blame for eating that shit up. 

The worst part is that this actually transfers into politics. For example, I've heard a few right wing politicians say on air ""the fact of the matter is that there are huge holes in the theory of evolution"" or ""there is a huge debate on whether climate change actually exists in the first place."" Some people who hear those statements just believe them and look no further into the matter. These same people get to vote on related issues even though they're inexcusably uninformed about them. People will believe anything which comes out of the mouth of a person they mutually respect, and when they see a politician with a good head of hair and a charismatic smile say a couple of one-line hooray statements like ""we need to fix this problem now!"" or ""it's time to make a change,"" they tend to trust the person's every word."

__________________________________________________ 

In my Sophomore year at High School, things were a slice of pie.  My GPA was good, I got in classes with my friends, and the garage band I was in was making some ground in the local scene.

Towards the last half of our school year in May I was in an English class with the lead singer in my band under a teacher we will name Mrs. Scots.  Mrs. Scots was in her early 50's at the time, but she was a young soul.  Anyway, up to this point most of the female teachers I've had since Preschool were one of two ways. 

1.  Authoritarian

2.  Softy Mommy

Mrs. Scots was an anomaly to me.  She was funny.  You could tell she partied, and that she was wild, but you could never break through the teacher/student barrier.  She still required you did all of the work, but when I and the lead singer were in her class we always finished before everyone, and she'd let us hangout in the back and chill.  During the state tests, she even joined us one time.

So it was no secret that we were in a band, but Mrs. Scots seemed to be out of the loop until we straight up told her.  We were asked by my friends in the school government to be the curtain act for an ""Air Band Talent Show"".  A real band.  We said yes of course, but we needed approval from our teachers.  

When we asked her, she said no and I didn't really know what to say to that.  She asked what type of music we played, and we told her punk rock.  She gave that approving head nod and then said  Okay, I'll agree to you guys skipping class tomorrow if you do me one favor.

""What's that?"" I asked.

""Do you guys know any Dave Matthews? Play me a Dave Matthews song and we're even.""  She replied.

We didn't know any Dave Matthews songs, but we took the deal.  You could tell by her face that she expected us to come to class the next day with our tails between our legs.  At which time, she would allow us to go anyways.  What she didn't expect was that come time for English class, we were nowhere to be scene.

The day before, after we talked to her, we got the rest of the band together, including my good friend ""Doofy"" who was a new addition, and didn't know how to play the guitar very well.  We held an emergency practice session to go over the set list.

We had decided that since people would be pretending to play other band's songs, we'd do the same and created a set list that was exclusively cover songs.  Some of them we sang like The Mighty Jungle, Ice Ice Baby, and Baby Got Back, and others like Brittany Spear's Lucky, we'd have random friends, who had the guts, come up and join us as lead (That song we had a defensive back on our football team sing).

Anyways, we set up on the little side stage, talked with some of the tech booth guys, and started to jam out as classes started to file in.  We played 8675309, and even a little talking heads and stuff till the show was about to start.  It was a lot of fun.

Then after the first band performed, The lights in the auditorium slowly started alighting.  When we could see the strings on our instruments, Green counted us in, and we played the opening cords to ""Crush"".  It was not easy adjusting it to sound decent without horns or keys, but we had been using the other songs since 8th grade allowing us to spend an entire night making this, and another song sound as good to perfect as we could, and if you were watching a video of the event, you could hear Mrs.  Scots' scream in glee.  The other teachers were amused, and a good deal of the staff sang along with the band as some of the girls we knew started dancing in front of the stage we were playing on.  A far better response than any of the ""air-bands"" got during their performance.  It was the first time  A curtain act at our school in a variety type show got more cheers than any of the contestants going for the $100 prize (we were doing this for free).

The only time it was louder was when we played ""Crash Into Me"" during the next act change/ closed curtain.  After the show Mrs. Scots came up to us, and couldn't lay her praises on us any thicker.  We were happy for the challenge, and it was really nice to make someone you respect and like so happy they have a hard time not crying.  Although it wasn't needed she had our backs for anything after that, and she was the 2nd teacher to refer to Me and my fellow band mates ""My boys"" when we were brought up in conversations,  but not ""you guys are my boys, yo.""  It was how women say it in that almost maternal, but loving way when they feel really close to a group of guys.  Sophomore was hard to top.

JeanRalfio,AskReddit,1389821013.0,"I went to a K-12 school because my town is tiny as hell. One day when I was in middle maybe high school, I was  killing time from class taking a shit in the stall. Unfortunately, shortly after getting down to business an elementary class came in on a bathroom break. On this day, I learned just how much little kids loved poop. 


I guess they liked when people didn't flush so they could see people's poop. They all ran in yelling ""I hope there's poop!"" and ""I wanna see some poop!"" Since there wasn't any in the other stall they thought the solution would be to see my poop, which caused them to riot and slam on the door yelling ""I want to see poop!"" 


I just wiped, called the rest of the remaining shit a loss, and slammed open the stall and ran away back to class. Didn't mention what had happened to my classmates.

TL;DR- Little kids love poop"

myfriendscantknow,PurplePillDebate,1389821032.0,"&gt;Essentially, the society has given different rules for the sexuality of men and the sexuality of women. It just so happens, the rules of sexual conduct for women are super hypocritical, and all over the place that as a result a woman who wishes to express her sexuality while still maintaing her conformity to society will express hypocrisy.

It's a product of the culture shift we are now experiencing. The mix of traditional values and slut shaming with sex positivism and progress puts women in a very awkward social situation. Women who aren't interested in hard-lining one way or the other (probably the vast majority of women) have to balance not appearing like a slut with not appearing like a prude. The social pressures put on women are intense, and in my opinion, a damn shame.

As soon as you contact the CPS those kids are going to be going down one hell of a long and dark road that is going to scar them for the rest of their lives.

Why? Because I think it makes sex fake. It makes men have these crazy ideals that I'm going to act like a porn star in bed to be sexy. I just want sex to be sex. I want it to be whatever is needed for us, at that moment. But I've been with guys who have compared me to porn stars, telling me I want good enough, wasn't as hot as them. Sorry dude, those girls get paid to look a certain way. I am a normal lady who has to work really hard to not be a lard butt lol. 

I just hate the expectations porn creates. I also hate that in our society porn is so ""normal"" . As if it's not normal for a man to not watch it. You're pretty much worse than Hitler for not wanting your man to watch porn. Just because ""everyone does it"". 

I would be fine with porn if it was mostly amateur stuff. Just couples filming themselves having a happy healthy sex live. Instead it's this weird twisted industry pushing out fake scenarios and fake people to people who start to expect fakeness. I've had multiple guys want me to make noises like porn stars or ""squirt"" because that's what they saw. I just wish it was normal to see and desire a relatively normal sex life.

I couldn't masturbate in my room because I didn't have a lock on the door.  So my nieces and sisters could walk in at any time and catch me.  So the bathroom was my best option.  My mother would bang on the door and tell me to ""stop that and get out!"".  It wasn't a very welcoming home for masturbation. 

If/when I have children, masturbation will be welcomed and encouraged to be done in private.  It's healthy.  It's normal.  And I STILL do it - so I wouldn't put pressure on my child NOT to do it!  Just don't do it in front of company and we're good."

dbaker102194,explainlikeimfive,1389821214.0,"This is some complex physics shit here. I'll do my best to dumb it down while still providing an accurate answer.

So, basically when a ship re-enters the atmosphere, it's moving so fast that the heat caused by the friction against the air causes the air to burn.  This gets hot, up to around 3000^o F. So there needs to be some protection or else the ship will burn up. 

This is where the heat shields become important. Heat shields come in a variety of forms, I believe 3 variants are currently in use. The most important type of heat shield is obviously the underside of the shuttle that takes all the friction and the majority of the heat. These heat shields are normally tiles that are about 6"" by 6"" and varying depth depending on the expected heat of re-entry. But normally anywhere from 3""-8"".

Now you might notice that the underside is normally black. It's actually the same material as the rest of the heat shield on the other side of the ship, but with a special coating. This coating is a glass-like polymer that dramatically reduces friction (and thus lowers the re-entry heat). Also these polymer coatings can withstand insanely hot temperatures, up to about 8000^o F. So there's no risk of them burning up, but they don't do a very good job of insulating (that is to say, while the reduce the amount of heat generated, they don't prevent the heat from getting to the ship.) 

That's where the Composite Fibrous Insulation comes into play. The whole ship is coated with this stuff. It's the white tiles that cover basically the whole ship. This is where the real insulation is done. There's a layer of the stuff underneath the polymer. It uses a fairly standard style of insulation, but is much more compressed than anything you'd get your hands on in a hardware store. Essentially the material has a very high heat tolerance, and doesn't transfer heat well. Then it's also got an ton of air pockets. The air pockets serve two purposes, by putting layers of the Composite Fibers the heat resistance is higher than if they just put one big block of the composite fibers. Which means they can resist more heat with less material, which is key for the second point, doing it with the air pockets reduces the weight.  

If you're still confused I would recommend a quick google search on ""thermodynamics"". But I'm still more than happy to answer any questions.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1389821237.0,"I gave a short response below, but after thinking about it I wanted to type out a longer one. As a fairly experienced woman who went through something similar with my boyfriend, I suspect there are three root causes:

The first is general insecurity and anxiety. There's going to be a concern about her sexual past, because the more experienced she is the more likely it is that she's been with men who have really rocked her world in bed, which can lead to conscious or subconscious concerns about whether or not you'll measure up, whether or not you'll satisfy her, and whether or not you can keep her. The fact is, though, *that doesn't matter* because she's with you. As another poster noted, she chose you, deliberately. You need to find a way to believe in that and trust that, full stop.

The second is an inability to escape subtle forms of sexism. You sound fairly sex-positive, which is probably why this hang-up confuses you. But I suspect you're having trouble escaping the whore-virgin dichotomy that seeps into our lives through so many different avenues. I think what you may have trouble admitting is that you can't help but judge her for her sexual behavior - that being sexually active and having very few sexual hang-ups somehow degrades her and lowers her worth in your eyes. In short, it makes her a slut, and no one wants to date or marry a slut. *This is actually very normal*. Many, many men are breaking out of the old sexist double-standard but don't realize how hard it can be to break those patterns of thought when they're reinforced culturally through a hundred different messages. The best way to deal with this is to confront it. Accept that you are dealing with conflicting messages. Embrace it. Then choose how you want to behave in response to it. So, for example, when you start feeling upset about her sexual past, tell yourself: ""I am having difficulty because I am judging her based on standards that I do not agree with. I feel this way, but I am not going to act on it, because I know this is hypocritical and unfair."" Then try your best to move on. Eventually you can re-train how you see her.

Finally, I think it is also triggered by an inherent need in all of us to feel special. Sex is, admittedly, an intimate moment between two people. The more people that intimacy is shared with, the more that you could feel it is cheapened. But the fact is, love doesn't cheapen. There is no limited quantity available. Her ability to love you and share intimacy with you is boundless because it is inherently unique - it is between you two, and that makes it special. What can help with this is focusing on the ways she makes you feel valued outside of the bedroom - remember she didn't just make the initial decision to chose you, she choses you every day. Focus on the ways she shows that to you, and that should help reinforce your bond.  "

Paimon,askGSM,1389821260.0,"Being trans and trying to prove to myself that I wasn't crazy and/or perverted I did a lot of research before and at the start of transition. What I've found so far has lead me to the following educated guess about things.

Firstly brains are sexually dimorphic, there are male brains and female brains, and there are multiple parts of the brain where these differences occur. Secondly, the default human brain is straight and female. (Note: Finding someone with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome who is also a lesbian would falsify the last statement).

Deviation from androphilic and female gender identity is a masculinization. In humans genitals differentiate before the brain does, and it is the presence or absence of an active SRY gene that determines whether or not someone will develop testes, but from there it is hormones produced both by the gonads and the mother that determine the development of genitals (masculinization again) and then brain.

Trans people have brains that either have been masculinized in spite of their gonads and genitals having not been masculinized, or vice versa. That is, trans women have female brains and trans men have male brains. The same is true of homosexual people, though in different parts of the brain. This is what I believe to be the reason that there are enough butch lesbians or effeminate gay men for the stereotype to exist. Their brains have had more or less masculinization in related parts of the brain, those that control social conformity and such (sadly I know much less about this side of things, and it's where my guess gets fuzzy). The simplest way to put it would be that Gay men are slightly female, and gay women slightly male, the ones who follow the stereotypes even more so. 

Of course gender identity is another part of the brain altogether, and so one can be slightly masculine or feminine without being male or female, and the other way round. Another interesting note is that trans people are about four times more likely to be attracted to their own gender as cis people, so trans women are slightly more likely to have masculine parts of their brains than cis women, and again, the reverse is true for trans men.

What all of this leads to is that it seems like both being gay and trans are neurological intersex conditions. So it's neither worse nor better to associate behavior with sexuality instead of gender, as they are both related even though they aren't the same thing. (Unless I'm completely wrong, in which case this whole post should be disregarded)"

How often do you have flashbacks/how are they to you?

Like, I'll have them whenever, it doesn't matter what I'm doing or what I'm thinking. I'll be talking to someone/reading something/banging my SO/... and all of a sudden I'll get this 'flash' that jolts through my head that is basically a feeling/sensation I had during a dream. Once I get one of those, all of a sudden my head will decide it's going to unload every dream I had that particular night on me (for some reason I remember dreams in sequence. If I remember 1 dream, I'll remember all/most dreams I had during that night). Sometimes years and years after I had them. I've had flashbacks to dreams from over 10 or sometimes even up to almost 15 years ago.

They freak out my SO though. We'll be having a conversation, and all of a sudden I'll just have this blank stare and she'll stop mid sentence and look at me weird, ask me what's going on and I'll be like ""shush, one second"", take my time to go through all the sensations, shake it off and go back to what I was doing. It took her a while to get used to it, but by now she's accepted it, and often knows I'm recalling dreams and just let me finish.

I dunno, I fucking love those flashbacks because they're so intense. They fuck with my head in a really cool way."

Besides, your point is absolutely ridiculous when you take into account the far, far greater failings of oligarchies, aristocracies, monarchies and dictatorships. I could write you a hundred books about a hundred different leaders who committed deplorable crimes when handed absolute power. To take a quote from Winston Churchill: ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others."" 

Okay, ignorance will increase. So...? You haven't even specified what the implications of this are, or whether it would be worse than before/worse than any alternative (assuming that your metrics even do capture this quality we call ""ignorance,"" which is a pretty massive leap of faith). There are no metrics that decide, because different people are good at different things. There is no one measurement called ""intelligence"" that captures the full sum of all human capabilities. I guarantee you that if not for the labor of so-called less ""intelligent"" people, you would not enjoy many of the comforts and opportunities that you have access to. Who would make your food? Pick up your trash? Build your computer? Anybody who's taken an economics course that society as a whole succeeds when people specialize in one area that they do best in and get what they need by trading with others, instead of being entirely self-sufficient. People who you think are ""ignorant"" are the only thing that make your current lifestyle possible. Are you so naive that you don't recognize that?

Your problem is that you think you have an entirely objective view of the situation, when in reality you can't know what the limits of your knowledge are. That's why modern academia is grounded in dialogue and peer review: so that we can *all* learn from the experiences and insight of others.

lemastersg,AskHistorians,1389821504.0,"I'll answer this the best I can from knowledge I've gained in-class and on my own research experience. It's not exactly my forte, but I'll give it a shot.

What I have to offer are a few historical examples of bastards in the Medieval period. The classic example (at least in my opinion) is William the Conqueror, who before he had this moniker was called ""Guillaume le Batard"" (William the Bastard). His mother was not exactly one you would call ""high born,"" and this be a very touchy subject with the Duke of Normandy throughout his entire life. He was his father's only son, but since he was illegitimate, he had quite the power struggle in his first few years of rule.

In general, however, whenever a nobleman would have children with a mistress (be she high or low-born), the resulting offspring would be given some sort of inheritance (land-holdings, usually) and quietly brushed off the stage of primogeniture and succession.

This more answers the ""What would happen"" part of your question, and not the ""female ruler"" part, of course. I can't say I know of any examples of an incumbent ruler bearing children during this specific period, but there are a few other relate-able cases like William's that may help:

Elizabeth I, Queen of England: Famously the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boelyn, became Queen under the controversy of her father's marriage. Many claimed that she was herself a bastard on the basis that Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon was illegal. She was also declared illegitimate by the Second Succession Act, under her father's reign. Also of interest to you may be the *unhistorical* film ""Anonymous,"" which plays with the hypothetical scenario of Elizabeth having bastard children (they similarly are given titles and swept under the rug).

Catherine the Great, Tsarina of Russia: This was a popular thread yesterday I believe, but Catherine took many male lovers and used them as political tools. Though this is outside of the specified timeline by some degree, she is in fact a female ruler. She had one son by her lover Grigori Orlov, Aleksey Grigorievich Brobinskoy. Brobinskoy was her only bastard, and was later made a Count by his legitimate half-brother, Emperor Paul. Catherine herself openly recognized that he was her son, and even temporarily allowed him to carry the name Romanov. Opponents of Catherine, I assume, couldn't really do much about Orlov or his son, since the Tsarina was really in control.

In short, it seems like bastards, being either descended from male or female rulers, were treated about the same as the birth-mothers themselves: the whole situation kept quiet but acknowledged."

mkvgtired,europe,1389821507.0,"I guess I should have said ""Federal European Agencies"" will gain power. I follow mostly the financial aspect of this process. The ECB and related federalized agencies like the EFSF have gained influence and funding over the past several years. There is a major push for a single European financial regulatory agency, if that fails, at least one regulator for the Eurozone. 

There is a ""one passport"" system for issuing securities and rules regulating cross border mergers and acquisitions of bank holding companies have been eased substantially. 

At least in the financial sense, power is being consolidated in centralized authorities. This isn't always a bad thing, except the UK is using its influence to gut any meaningful sections of these new regulations. European securities issuing laws are some of the most lenient in the developed world thanks to the UK (and other EU nations with large financial sectors). This also goes for other European banking regulations. Investment banks in the US complain its ""unfair"" and say they cant compete, but the race to the bottom argument is easy to make. 

So I guess I should have been more specific. At least in the financial sense, power is being centralized fairly quickly, and I only see it becoming more centralized as time goes on."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389821546.0,"I generally believe that encouraging women's sexual expression is a good thing. Porn can often do that, but sometimes it doesn't. 

I realize now that I've been empowered by porn on hand and inhibited by it on the other.  Porn has taught me a lot about sexuality, but it took a while to realize that it doesn't really teach me about *my* sexuality. Porn has given me a sometimes crippling mentality that I need to ""perform"" during sex. It's easier sometimes to enjoy sex if you let go of the preconceived notions of what you thought you would enjoy based on porn. I had to teach myself to masturbate without porn sometimes to really engage with myself during sex, if that makes sense. When I watch porn it's more like part of me disengages from myself. But these aren't things I would blame the industry for. I think the problem is having too much access to porn at a relatively young age, due to the internet. 

As far as the industry goes, I get bothered by porn that seems non-consensual. Rape fantasies, humiliation, BDSM, etc. are OK to me if it is clearly just pretend. It's important that people explore their fantasies. However, even when it is clear that it is consensual, I do fear what it will be like if these types of fantasies become too normalized. To me the appeal of these things is by nature tied to them being taboo. If they are about openly glorifying abuse, it's kind of sick. It's important for mainstream porn to be about women who appear to really be enjoying the sex because I do think porn influences our ideas about sex and turn-ons. I would rather that it be considered ideal for women to participate actively in sex than for it to become the norm to hurt or humiliate them.

For that reason, I have trouble with Japanese porn. It bothers me that almost all of the videos are based on men overpowering a woman. Women are given no agency. Even if she enjoys the sex, she can only enjoy it reluctantly.  It's the fact that these aren't just a subcategory of videos, but actually the mainstream, that bothers me. I am from Japan and being groped is an everyday threat there, so the fact that there are so many groping videos really bothers me. I think a lot of the videos are not made consensually, and even the ones that are are exploitative because they encourage it as a cultural phenomenon. In the context of a society where women are oppressed, porn that glorifies oppression just hurts women more. I also think it is oppressive that porn is so in-your-face there. Men openly look at porn magazines in public; they are sold all over the place. A lot of anime is very sexualized. I think these kinds of images can be oppressive when you are surrounded by them - especially when they sexualize women by emphasizing their weakness.

keakealani,Hawaii,1389821601.0,"It's not yet fully completed, but we've started compiling a [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/wiki/index) with some information about traveling. There are also some FAQs linked on the sidebar so I'd recommend checking those out as well. 

To answer your specific questions, though:

1) This really depends on what your interests are. In terms of museums/historical sites, I think ʻIolani Palace (former residence of Hawaiian royalty and site of Liliʻuokalani's imprisonment) and/or Washington Place (former Governor's mansion, one Liliʻuokalani's private homes, general museum about the Queen and that time era) are really ""must-do"". I believe you do have to reserve tours in advance for both locations but they're right next to each other so it may be possible to see both at the same time. Pearl Harbor/USS Arizona Memorial are also pretty neat, especially if you're interested in WWII history. 

Obviously, it's sort of a ""must-do"" to see some of Oʻahu's natural beauty so at least one beach and at least one hike would be pretty requisite. Diamond Head is a pretty easy hike to access from the Waikīkī area so that's one option, although it's not a super intense hike (the view is still pretty great, though. Koko Head, Makapuʻu Lighthouse, Waʻahila Ridge, Mānoa Falls, and Kuliʻouʻou are some other trails I know of that are pretty fun. Some are closer to Waikīkī than others but if you have a car then it shouldn't be that difficult. 

As far as beaches - well, there are tons so it's hard to really be specific. It may be more about what you specifically want to do and where you want to go. I personally tend to like the east and north shore beaches but that's also because I grew up with more opportunities to go to that side of the island. There are also some really nice west side beaches too. South shore is hit or miss - obviously in Waikīkī proper there are a lot of tourists and some of the beaches are kind of crowded as a result. But there are some gems and there are some activities that are really ideal for south shore conditions, like paddleboarding. 

2) Honestly there are a million things that are technically off the beaten path, but it is hard to generically comment on everything. There are lots of wonderful smaller restaurants and things like that, but it may depend on what your food tastes are and where you're going. Some communities near-ish to Waikīkī but cater to more residential customers include Kaimukī/Kahala, Kapahulu/Diamond Head (to some extent - some stuff is touristy but other stuff is less so), Kakaʻako/Ward (again, some stuff is touristy and other stuff isn't), Mānoa/Makiki/Mōʻiliʻili, Kalihi/Pālama, etc. I'd honestly just check some Yelp reviews for things that sound interesting to you and check it out. If you have a really specific request, feel free to ask but it's hard to be too general. 

3) Again, this depends a bit on your taste. In general, I think the only thing I'd say is definitely not that awesome is the touristy lūʻau they do at random hotels and stuff. If you want to try Hawaiian food, there are regular Hawaiian restaurants like Helena's or ʻOnos that are cheaper and better food. Some touristy options can be fun especially if it's your first time and you just want to ""get the experience"". One thing I'd put in that category is Hanauma Bay - it can be kind of touristy but it's also pretty cool to do the snorkeling and see all the marine life if you haven't seen that kind of stuff before. But, if you miss it I don't think it's the end of the world, either - unless you're a serious marine biology buff (in which case, there are better ways to see wildlife, like actual scuba tours) it's not *that* interesting. 

4) I'm not really a nightlife person so I can't comment, but yeah, basically all of Waikīkī *is* nightlife. The only reason locals go there is for the bars and clubs. It's a pretty typical tourist area nightlife so it pretty much offers whatever you like. I've only ever been to a few clubs so I can't really recommend anything specific but again, check sites like Yelp for reviews and just check out stuff that sounds interesting. 

Finally, about visiting another island - with only 5 days, I wouldn't recommend it. Especially because you *are* planning on doing Oʻahu, you simply can't get that much done in only a few days. Honolulu is consistently rated for having some of the worst traffic in the country and even if you stay away from big commutes (which means you will be skipping things like North Shore, East side beaches/hikes, possibly places like Pearl Harbor, etc.) it's hard to experience very much in such a short time. 

If you do want to visit another island, I think Kauaʻi and Big Island are both fine choices, for similar reasons. Both are slightly more rural (and therefore more ""local"") in feel compared to urban Oʻahu. There are sights to see on both islands - Kalalau Valley/Nāpali is the obvious choice on Kauaʻi and as you mention, the Big Island has active volcanoes. 

With the volcanoes, by the way, keep in mind that Hawaiʻi's volcanoes are primarily the shield type, with slow moving lava that leaks out of volcanic vents. While there are some more explosive moments, it's not like Vesuvius or Mt. St. Helen which were different types of volcanoes. I still think the lava floes are interesting, and most Americans won't get many opportunities to see an active volcano in action, but don't necessarily expect to see some sort of huge killer explosion, but instead probably some smaller explosions and some regular red hot molten rock leisurely rolling down the mountain side. 

Anyway, I'll let people from those respective islands put in their perspective, but hopefully this helps! :)"

I can tell you that my cut boyfriend is the best fuck of my life, as he would be if he were not cut, and that at the end of the day what matters is that you find someone with whom you click sexually. Maybe he would have enjoyed sex more with a foreskin, but unfortunately it is gone now, and the fact remains that he does enjoy sex very much and does not waste his emotional capital any more worrying about something that is very difficult to change if at all- foreskin restoration does not work for everyone, it is fine to try, but no shame if it does not work out.

greensmurf30,summonerschool,1389821749.0,"I love this response. Short and sweet and to the point.

I also like how the advice isn't just centered around learning just one champion in and out (although there are certainly advantages to that). It can certainly be beneficial, and more importantly fun, to experiment around with different supports and change up how you want to play a particular match up. And like someone else said before - don't sweat the laning phase too much. It will end eventually.

Lastly - I like bot lane because I like working with someone in lane to make plays. But you should communicate! Good lane and player synergy comes from active communication from both parties. Support champs like Taric/Alistar can go all in or sustain - a lot of it depends on that third point, player synergy. Don't be afraid to ask, or set up plays, like: ""Let's go for a lvl 2 trade"" or ""Ult is up - i'll ping when I'm going in"". Alternatively, feel out how your partner wants to play as well. Nothing is worse than a bot lane where both players are on different pages."

RichardBehiel,AskReddit,1389821794.0,"I think that the idea that everyone should go to college is wrong, and as a corollary I think that a bunch of the ""easier"" majors are rendered essentially useless by overcrowding.  

If intelligence isn't your thing and you can't handle getting some sort of STEM degree, then maybe college just isn't your thing.  That's *fine.*  Not everybody is smart, just like not everybody is tall and not everybody is really, really, ridiculously good-looking.  Find what you're good at and do it, even if that doesn't involve going the typical college route.

I mean come on, paying university tuition in order to major in something like philosophy, black culture, or feminist studies is a waste of time.  I've never heard of any white culture classes or masculist studies, but those would probably be pretty useless too.  

*Maybe* 5% of people who major in those fields will actually find work pushing their virus of a subject into the minds of future out-of-place college students, while the rest will have to work menial jobs at Walmart since they're buried in student loans and don't have any marketable skills. 

So why not save your (parents') $100k and start a small business instead, maybe open a coffee shop or a bookstore or something, or go to a trade school and learn some vocational skill that has actual intrinsic value.  I don't know, just do something to actually contribute to society.

I've been told because I don't remember much of the night that I got very loud and demanding. 
When I was asked to be quiet because I might wake the neighbors I just shouted at the top of my intoxicated lungs ""FUCK THE NEIGHBORS"" several times... the house I was in also had people sleeping in it...
What seemed like a few hours later I was finding increasingly difficult to move without holding onto the floor and shortly after this I passed out.
I wake up. Still pissed, I stand and tell everyone to 'Wait!' I go to the bathroom for a record breaking piss and when I returned I realized I couldn't feel my face. I told everyone that was awake as best I could I went back to sleep.

AgentDL,AskMen,1389821947.0,"&gt; So then it's unfathomable to imagine a person who is okay with an open relationship and the emotions involved?

I don't think you can use the same logic to claim that this converse statement is true. 

I think it's pretty safe to say that people who are NOT OK with open relationships are the overwhelming *majority.* It makes sense to me why these people would question people who ARE OK with open relationships, because most of us have never met one or know very little about that mindset. 

On the other hand, people who ARE OK with open relationships (like OP) are the overwhelming *minority.* Virtually all of the people around them have a different view of relationships. The fact that the general public values monogamy over open relationships *pervades our society* and is represented everywhere in the media and daily life. It is, in my opinion, impossible to avoid, so it makes much less sense for that 1-in-100 person to not understand the mindset of the 99 other people, as opposed to the other way around."

We have well over 500 other people in Congress who vote on issues. When it comes down to election time, I think a lot of people know who they want to be president, but they don't know any of the names or ideologies of the senatorial or representative candidates, and so they either vote for a random person, vote for a person who they've heard once or twice on TV, vote for the people who belong to their preferred party, or they don't vote at all.

mmp31,technology,1389822002.0,"&gt;How do you know the original intent of lawmakers? 

Read what they wrote about the Constitution.

&gt;Did they intend the 5th Amendment to be used to regulate pollution? 
That seems like a more expansive interpretation of government authority than the Commerce Clause itself, and could be used to justify all kinds of government power.

No, they intended for the 5th amendment to protect individuals from having their life and property deprived without due process of law.  Which pollution does IMO.  I think any reasonable person would agree with me.

&gt;Posing an extreme hypothetical doesn't invalidate the entire idea of legal precedent.

I never claimed it did.  It invalidates the idea that legal precedent is the only correct way to interpret the Constitution.

&gt;Even if we assume that what you described actually happens, there is a mechanism for dealing with it. Congress could impeach the President and the public could elect a new President who would appoint new justices. 

That's right.  People like me who disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution can vote for politicians who agree with my interpretation of the Constitution and take the necessary steps to implement it.  That doesn't mean I'm ""inventing"" my interpretation any more than the Supreme Court did.

&gt;But this is very different from the Supreme Court upholding the ability of the government to regulate commerce between the states. 

&gt;If your argument rests on the idea that the entire Commerce Clause concept is invalid, then you are taking about overturning not just net neutrality but all kinds of laws and regulations. There is no realistic chance of that happening, so I think you'd be better off making an argument within the framework of actually existing law.

Just becuase my ideas have little chance of being implemented doesn't mean that I shouldn't voice the idea.  That's an extremely absurd mindset that works against free thinking.  

Also, *I did* make an argument within the framework of the existing commerce clause interpretation; you just chose to ignore it because it was convenient to do so.  I said we should repeal the laws that enable companies like Comcast and Verizon to retain their monopoly over the market."

- His mind doesn't work fast enough to be an NBA point guard.  He puts himself into bad positions and can't correct until it's too late.

- He is a bad ball handler.  I'd rather have Boogie take the ball up instead of Jimmer.

- He can't defend.  I can think of few players who are worse at man defense.  

- He has one NBA caliber skill: shooting.  At the same time, he struggles to create his own shot and isn't as dominant a shooter as other career 3-point specialists.  

I hate watching games when Jimmer gets hot.  Fans go crazy and everyone talks about how Jimmer is developing.  They don't mention the fact that he probably turned the ball over a few times, let his man blow by him, and wasted a fast break opportunity because he didn't read the defense.

He's still doing the judgmental thing. Homophobia is homophobia, at the end of the day. Not everyone needs to attend Pride, but I'd say a basic belief that homosexuality *is not* against nature, or God, or a sin is pretty fundamental to the whole ""not a total bigot"" thing."

4x Arbor Elf

2-4x Primeval Titan

1x Craterhoof Behemoth

4x (Another Mana dork but you level him up)

4x Burning Tree Emissary 

4x Some 3CMC uncommon that when it comes into play, return target card into your hand

1x Arbor Colossus

4x Genesis Wave

4x Utopia Sprawl

4x Nykthos

1x Kessig Wolf Run

2x Boseju

Xx Forests

Basically the deck usually goes;

T1: Forest, Manadork

T2: Nykthos, Tap mana dork to put Utopian Sprawl onto Forest and tap 2 for BTE, BTE, use floating mana for Garruk/Primeval. Use Primeval's search for Kessig Wolf Run

T3: Activate Kessig Wolf Run for +200000000/+0 trample on Primeval, win the game

OR

T3: Genesis Wave for ~15, you'll probably hit another Nykthos or Garruk so the new ones will come into play untapped. Tap/Untap/Tap them to float even more mana, and use the 3 CMC uncommon to bring back the genesis wave OR use Craterhoof OR use Kessig etc.

If he doesn't get any BTEs, he'll do everything mentioned in T4 instead.

Anyway, it's a very consistent turn 4 kill. The only thing that I have that can stop him is if I have a nut draw from my bant hexproof deck."

The previous suggests something entirely different, and the facts you are giving us aren't really lining up....

Was it ONE friend who was there when your girlfriend was slapped??? Also, were you completely aware of the state of her friendship with these people when you first started dating? You don't have a place in saying who she spends her time with, especially if you knew beforehand.

He could have called, emailed, or sent a birthday card once a year and I would give him a chance.

I have no need or want for him in my life and they just keep bringing it up which is pretty upsetting. He's not some missing piece to my life puzzle. He's nothing to me.

Most in the social sciences don't need grants because any study they may do will generally not require much funding - they're generally thought experiments - they can rock the boat all they want without fear of financial retribution. Those that will need any significant amount of funding must steer clear of making controversial statements (and as a general rule of thumb, this excludes *most* non-STEM research).

Now, overwhelmingly unanimous in the public sphere doesn't equal true, which is why, and this gets back to the crux, even if not explicitly stated, and would require further study. But, if you have to fear making statements that will get your funding revoked/diminished/denied, can't happen. And now we're full circle - the conservatives that hold the purse strings don't like liberal research that rocks the status quo, regardless of any truth to it or not."

gravvs,AskReddit,1389822465.0,"I'm not recommending that anybody smoke. However you are mistaken. You do not smoke and you clearly haven't read any of the articles that people are linking. You are speaking from ignorance.

The hypothesis raised in the study is that if smoking truly regulates stress, then non smokers should have higher stress levels. It was found that non-smokers including ex smokers have higher overall stress levels and higher baseline levels. This is true. The data and my personal experiences line up and support this. When I am smoking my baseline stress levels ""slightly increase."" (Their language not mine).

However the study doesn't deal with short term stress relief, which is why I like cigarettes. They are highly effective at granting about ten minutes of zero stress. It takes about five to seven minutes for me to smoke a cigarette. I have about three minutes afterwards. Then the stress comes back. 

The stress that nicotine relieves is not the nicotine craving. I've gone six months without smoking and without cravings, but then I'll be stressed out and choose to start smoking again and it immediately relieves stress. 

Smoking is a tool for me. When I takes breaks I go cold turkey. I have a set age after which I won't smoke again. 

And no it's not working magically. Nicotine gives you a head rush. It's like a little high that lasts ten minutes and then it's done. It makes stress disappear for ten minutes. Unless you smoke you won't understand this. And that's a good thing.

Don't start smoking. It's unhealthy. It's bad in the long term.

Ruphuz,TwoXChromosomes,1389822466.0,"For the longest time, I used to have hair down to my waist and the idea of cutting it all off was really scary. It felt like I would be losing a limb or something. I felt like my hair was a part of my identity, as crazy as that might sound. 

Then over the course of several months I did the whole ""cut it shorter a little bit at a time thing"" which got me used to the idea of having short hair, but also let me waver on how short I actually would go. 

Then one night, after joking about it for several months, I decided to say ""fuck it"" and shave it off. All of it. It was scary and I was terrified about what people would think. And that I might have a weird shaped head with a giant dent in it or something.

I got mixed reactions. My friends and partners loved it. My coworkers were all just shocked that I actually did it. And strangers would stare at me. Some of them were downright rude and would glare at me as if having a shaved head were some crime against nature or something.

I didn't do it because I wanted to shock people or to make a statement or in support of someone else. I did it because I wanted to. Because I was tired of worrying about what people thought of me. Because I wanted to make decisions based on what I wanted, not what I thought other people wanted. 

It was an amazing, strengthening, liberating experience.

Sometimes it doesn't matter why you want to do something. If it's not going to have a negative impact on anyone or yourself, then who cares? It's your hair, your life, your head, and you have the right to do whatever you want with it.

Marie Stopes International
Established in London in 1976, Marie Stopes International (MSI) works with over 4.8 million people in over 38 countries throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe providing a comprehensive range of sexual and reproductive health services. The organisation has gained a global reputation as a provider of safe motherhood and quality family planning services, including obstetrics and pre and post-natal care, education, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; HIV/AIDS education, counselling and testing, and safe abortion. Programmes designed specifically to benefit marginalised and vulnerable communities such as adolescents, refugees and internally displaced people are a major focus of MSI’s work.

Population Services Zimbabwe
Population Services Zimbabwe (PSZ), Marie Stopes International's partner in Zimbabwe, was established in 1987. It operates seven centres across the country, all of which provide low-income communities with the means to prevent unwanted pregnancies and protect their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Linked to this is a network of community-based distributors who work closely with local community groups to raise awareness of SRH issues including HIV/AIDs. They also disseminate information, distribute oral contraceptives and condoms. A voluntary surgical contraceptive mobile unit works very closely with the centres, communities, local authorities and government health institutions helping to educate the public about permanent methods of family planning. PSZ also has a specially tailored project for adolescents, working closely with youth centres to offer young people the services they need to avoid teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections."

You can report anonymously, and they will not reveal where their information came from. In all likelihood, nothing will happen from the first report. But you need to call and tell them what happens, because then there will be a record of concern. In the future, when a teacher or other mandated reporter notices something, they'll file another report and your report will become evidence even though there's no physical abuse yet. The children won't be removed from the home (probably) but the court can mandate parenting classes and counseling. If there is physical abuse, the children still won't be dropped into foster care. Most states do their best to keep children with friends or family, and put the back with their parents as soon as possible.

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389822539.0,"Dwight Howard isn't the best center anymore.  I've had this fight in other threads and it was never a very popular opinion.  

I honestly think that if GMs had a fantasy draft to finish out the season (even a non-keeper draft), Howard would go 2nd at best and could drop to 4 or 5.  

His rebounding rate and defensive rate (his two greatest attributes) are on par with other elite bigs, but he doesn't dominate either area.  His offensive game is still unpolished and doesn't do a lot to open up the game for his team.  

I think that there are at least 3 other centers that could be plugged into Howards spot that would generate more wins: DMC, Anthony Davis, Roy Hibbert.  I even think that Greg Monroe could impact the game as well as Dwight Howard.  

The only reason Howard is as well regarded as he is is because people still think he has the ability he had in 2010.  He doesn't.  Post injury he has regressed.  


When the Rockets get bounced in the offseason, be prepared to read articles about how Dwight has lost his magic and he isn't the elite player he once was. I guarantee that by this time next year, most people will not consider Dwight as a candidate for the best center in the league.

- 21.7 PER, .169 ws/48min, 109 offensive rating, 100 defensive rating, 20.5% rebounding rate, .579%efg, 34.2 minutes per game

Player B:

- 20.5 PER, .180 ws/48min, 118 offensive rating, 106 defensive rating, 14.8% rebounding rate, .530efg, 33.3 minutes a game.

Player C: 

- 27.6 PER, .187 ws/48min, 109 offensive rating, 101 defensive rating, 20.2% rebounding rate, .497%efg, 32.4 minutes per game.

For reference, Player A averages 18.3 points and 12.7 boards a game.  Player B averages 18.3 points and 9.2 rebounds a game.  Player C averages 23.5 points and 11.6 boards a game.  

Looking at those numbers, C looks like a pretty obvious choice.  A and B are somewhat close, but B takes the cake.  

Player C is Demarcus Cousins, B is Howard and A is Nikola Pekovic.  

Looking at the numbers, Cousins seems to have a bigger gap on Howard than Howard has on Pekovic.  Is Pek as good as Howard? No, not even close... But it's not a good sign that Pekovic (a definitely-not-top-5 center) looks almost as good on paper.  "

Yeah screw those people who are dying every day in other countries! Even if our country has implemented systems to help the poor, and even if some of the other countries' problems were because of us.

""I don't care for severely disabled people at all. You know the ones I mean. They can't ever care or even think for themselves. They make me incredibly uncomfortable and I would prefer they didn't exist. Everyone would be better off."" +268 (gilded)

I also went about 2 months without shaving my legs (ha, I visited home for school break, where my parents live out in the middle of no-where and not many people were around to see me anyway).  I noticed that the growth there stopped at about 3 weeks in, at maybe a little less than half an inch.  It's super light and pretty fine for me, so I guess I'm lucky there.

I don't really ever really skip shaving my armpits, so I don't know about there, but it's probably similar to my legs.

I'm fine with my hair growth rate.  If I could magically make my head hair grow slower so that I could go longer between dye jobs, but be able to revert that when I needed to, that would be nice (though it's pretty long now).  My bangs also grow super fast (way faster than even the rest of my hair), so I have to trim them every week."

Maybe some of you don't have a problem with this. That is your call. Its your money. However, its a huge moral dilemma for many people like me because here you have an org that sounds like its coming to save the day when on the darker side its basically going around killing off the poor rather than helping them.

Truth be told, I don't think its worth it. There are plenty of other organizations out there that still help people without this kind of blatant racial / regional population control. I don't think this is something a community based on the principles of love and friendship can proudly support, despite the jokes and playful emotes we may use ironically or otherwise.

vazzaroth,truegaming,1389822698.0,"I've never felt forced to use variety, it's my natural instinct. Even in a game like Path of Exile where you have to build your character from the start with very limited skill resets, I can only play the same character for 3-5 levels at a time before I need to spend some time on an Alt to ""refresh"" my enjoyment, since I'm doing the same thing over and over to utilize all my passives.

In Bioshock I'd just use whatever weapon I currently maxed the ammo out with, since I didn't like leaving ammo laying around while I was full on a type.

I had to quit World of Tanks entirely since I had too many damn tanks to grind with and I enjoyed them all. However, the higher tier takes SOOOOOO much XP required to rank up that I was making basically zero progress after tier 4 or 5 (of 10) and just had like 20 Tier 2-3 tanks and maybe a few higher Tiers. Meanwhile, I see people on the reddit posting screens showing 2 or 3 of their Tier X tanks. I don't understand how anyone can do the same thing so much, I just get bored of the repetition!

I had similar problems as in WoT with games like Call of Duty. CoD has a whole slew of other issues with variety too. They seem to purposely make a few ""best"" guns that the entire community uses. I will, therefor, avoid those guns like the plauge and I tend to make loadouts based on TF2 classes instead.

So, in summary, no, I don't force myself to use variety, it's the only way I have fun while playing. If the game forces you into a ""Best"" solution, I generally quit playing instead."

It's just like in weightlifting. You don't go in and say your goal is to squat 1000lbs. You go in and say your goal is to squat, say, twice your bodyweight. And your real goal is to just get into the gym regularly. To analyze your program, look for areas which may not be beneficial to your squat and to discard these things. Look for what has improved your squat (after a few years of recording and lifting and rigorous reflection), and you add it in and keep doing it. You look at the long-term mathematic progression of your program over set periods of time and can discern what is effective and what is useless or ineffective. And when you can squat twice your bodyweight, your goal is three times. And then four times. But the goal itself is to just practice. To reflect. To analyze. Every day. That is the goal. And if you maintain that goal, you will find yourself squatting 500 pounds. And then 600. And then, if you're really dedicated and really gifted, maybe 700, 800, 900...

*  Everything else, apostrophe that shit up when it's showing possession. If the word ends in an ""s"", stick the apostrophe on the end instead of adding another ""s."""

Tavarish,Games,1389822752.0,"Mantle isn't open source.

&gt;Q: Is Mantle open source ?

&gt;A: No. It is an API for the industry-standard GCN Architecture and its specific ISA, done at the request of game developers.

[Source](https://twitter.com/Thracks/status/383872285351739393), he is AMD's Robert Hallock, Enthusiast Graphics Marketing Manager

It's not bound to certain architecture, like [this](http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=131836&amp;d=1384379936) picture states [It's from November, 2013], but I doubt they have done it open source. I really doubt AMD gives keys to its baby even if they have opened some room for Nvidia to try and adapt Mantle.

Also that slide suggests to me that it's not just some simple *""Do some drivers, slap them on and and Mantle works on yours Nvidia PC!""* -job, but would require some architecture changes from Nvidia so they would benefit 100% from Mantle.

Has AMD offered do co-development with Nvidia? If not then it's another sign that AMD wants to keep API interface design and versioning all to themselves.

In the end it's waiting game at this point and yet to be seen how Nvidia reacts to Mantle. Will they try adapt it or do own API or just stay out of API game."

Not only did they get several sacks, but they pressured Luck into throwing off-balance and quick quite often.  Luck happens to be quite strong and made a few plays on good rushes, but he was also forced into a number of bad reads and off-target throws.

An important thing to understand is that with a QB like Luck who can take off and run, you have to be much more cautious in your rush lanes to prevent him from breaking containment and just running up the sideline like Cam Newton did earlier in the season.  Against Manning, where that is much less of an issue, expect to see much more dynamic pass rushing.  Of course, Manning makes some pretty quick reads and gets the ball out fast for that very reason."

Second, it's the overboard thing. Too much of it is too extreme, and too tolerant of ideas that are really wrong, on a level that a basic student of their sort of wheelhouse studies (philosophy, sociology, gender studies, history, etc) should be able to figure out in five minutes.

SRD can get a little wacky when it gets too circlejerky too.

Although technically a higher refresh rate and fps also requires higher memory bandwidth, at any given resolution the difference is trivial. Any GPU with 2GB of VRAM on at least a 256-bit memory bus has plenty of memory performance for up to 2560x1600 resolutions, which is often the max they can display. That is why the super high end video cards (780 Ti or R9-290x), which have relatively huge memory bandwidths, scale better to 4k resolutions than you might expect compared to a pair of 770s or r9-280Xs. At lower resolutions, performance scaling from SLI or crossfire is better than at higher resolutions because the memory is not as severely taxed. "

1. Don't trust the internet. People lie all the time. Sometimes, they don't even deliberately lie, they are just negligent and omit information that they didn't deem relevant.

2. You don't know their personal situation. They could be living right on Wall Street, in which case that 60k annual is almost nothing. They could be living in the ghettos. 

3. There will always be someone supposedly doing better than you. Suppose you get a new job, doubling your income, but need to move to a wealthier neighbourhood for more convenient commute to your new workplace. Now you'll have a new Jones family to compare yourself to. It'll never end.

The best thing to do is just worry about your personal situation. Use mathematics and awareness of financial instruments to determine with absolute certainty whether your lifestyle is financially sustainable and whether you can live comfortably. Don't over-rely on others' lives as a guidance. 

If you want a comparison/marker for improvement, the best one is your past self. Are you doing better this year than you were last year? Congrats, if you are."

Tiki_Lamp,AskReddit,1389822984.0,"No he's wrong, though.

Depression isn't feeling sorry for yourself, it's just kind a lack of feeling. It's emptiness. You're not sad. You're not happy. You're empty. You feel like a robot, and you're still a logical being, which brings you to question why you don't feel anything. You're supposed to feel something right? Things happen, emotions are the reaction, that's how people work. 

But if you don't work how people work, you question it, and you'd be scared, but you don't feel scared either. You'd be sad about it, but you don't feel sad. You just don't. You sure as hell don't feel ""sorry"" for yourself. You are just hyper aware of the lack of substance in what you're sure should be an amazingly full life, because that's what everyone else seems to have: substance."

Marie Stopes International
Established in London in 1976, Marie Stopes International (MSI) works with over 4.8 million people in over 38 countries throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe providing a comprehensive range of sexual and reproductive health services. The organisation has gained a global reputation as a provider of safe motherhood and quality family planning services, including obstetrics and pre and post-natal care, education, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; HIV/AIDS education, counselling and testing, and safe **ABORTION**. Programmes designed specifically to benefit marginalised and vulnerable communities such as adolescents, refugees and internally displaced people are a major focus of MSI’s work.

Population Services Zimbabwe
Population Services Zimbabwe (PSZ), Marie Stopes International's partner in Zimbabwe, was established in 1987. It operates seven centres across the country, all of which provide low-income communities with the means to prevent unwanted pregnancies and protect their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Linked to this is a network of community-based distributors who work closely with local community groups to raise awareness of SRH issues including HIV/AIDs. They also disseminate information, distribute oral contraceptives and condoms. A voluntary surgical contraceptive mobile unit works very closely with the centres, communities, local authorities and government health institutions helping to educate the public about permanent methods of family planning. PSZ also has a specially tailored project for adolescents, working closely with youth centres to offer young people the services they need to avoid teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections."

I'm far from an expert on Swedish politics so I welcome someone with specific knowledge of the political environment there to comment, but the Wikipedia page's section ""official position"" (i.e. position of the Swedish government on its laws) does suggest a pretty strong connection with feminism:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Sweden#Official_position

&gt; The Swedish Government believes that women selling sexual services to men constitutes a form of violence against women which should be eliminated by reducing demand. Demand for women's sexual services is constructed as a form of male dominance over women, and as a practice which maintains patriarchal hegemony. [51][52] (see feminist arguments against prostitution). This legal and social approach to prostitution, which has become known as the ""Swedish Model"" or more recently the ""Nordic Model"", needs to be understood—at least partly—in the context of radical feminism (a philosophy which focuses on the theory of the patriarchal roots of inequality between men and women), which is very prominent in Sweden.

You haven't shown one instance of a foul being called to warrant a change in strategy and it isn't hard to throw a basketball accurately that far.  One UK player throwing it into the scoreboard doesn't completely negate other instances of a decent pass.

You are also completely throwing out any argument that tip ins happen unless it's a full court tip in which is ridiculous to me.  If the NBA got rid of the advancing rule there would be a lot more instances of tip ins going in on full court passes.

Depends on how you define ""Satanist"".

If you are going multi-GPU, you need additional performance mostly to run the PCI-e bus, which is partly determined by the motherboard chipset as well. The i5-4570k is a popular option because it handles all modern games with ease, it overclocks, and it very power-efficient. The cheaper i5-4570 with a cheaper B85 or H87 motherboard is most likely indistinguishable in any gaming situation. But you can go as low as an $80 quad-core athlon without seeing a noticeable performance drop on a typical 1080p gaming computer. 

You should focus much more on the GPU of your system for gaming performance. The CPU choice is really determined by how much you want to spend. Here are some benchmarks that show at 1920x1200, there is hardly any difference between the most powerful and least powerful CPU in gaming performance with a radeon 7970, which is still a solidly high-end graphics card for gaming: http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/radeon_hd_7970_cpu_scaling_performance_review,1.html"

Tavarish,Games,1389823429.0,"It's also pile of bullshit that Mantle is some easy *wave yours magic wand and slap on some drivers* -job. AMD maybe isn't locked Mantle into theirs GPU's, but they openly say that it's 100% designed with theirs current architecture mind.

Nvidia maybe could get *most* out of Mantle without architecture alterations, but to get all out of it [lets be honest, you want all benefits of it] they would need to do some redesigning.

Judging from quick reading Nvidia offered PhysX and CUDA shit to AMD, but AMD turned them down. Now that shit costs if AMD wants it, but they don't.

AMD killed OpenCL themselves as they dropped ball with it halfway through and as far I know TressFX is dogshit on Nvidia GPU's even this day. Mantle, it's what it's and would require Nvidia to design into direction of theirs largest competitor [AMD]. I haven't read up on Gsync or FreeSync.

It will be interesting if Nvidia bothers with Mantle supporting drivers and see how good Mantle actually is **if** GPU architecture isn't designed for it."

Ensurdagen,fireemblem,1389823463.0,"""Rescue"" has been a similar mechanic, with similar tactical outcomes (make ground units fly, move farther in one turn, etc.) except it makes the unit doing the rescuing less powerful.

Brightt,LucidDreaming,1389823466.0,"The walk through is usually what I do in order to remember all the details right after I wake up. I have trouble doing it later though, if I want to remember something hours after I woke up, I'll have forgotten a lot. But I usually put my alarm 15mins earlier in order to mentally walk through my dreams and then I'll have it saved pretty well. Although flashbacks happen to dreams I didn't try to recall in the morning as well, which is even cooler.

I've actually planned on working on it more actively, and I think that if I put a bit of effort into it, I can go lucid every night as well. I've just been content with the current state of my dreams that I never had any initiative to amp things up.

Oh, I started a lot younger though. I discovered it when I was like 5 or 6 years old, and I can still remember dreams from back then, although the only ones I can remember from that long ago (I'm 20) are some of the recurring nightmares I had.

Btw, it's spelled ""voilà"" ;)

I dunno, I didn't particularly like, nor hate nightmares before I started sleeping together with my SO regularly, but since I've started doing so, I'll even *hope* that I'll have nightmares, because they're both really exciting, and the feelings when she calms me down and holds me is just.. Amazing. It makes me feel really loved, which is great.

How did you solve dreams where you lose control though? An example from last week, I was dreaming that we were on a skiing trip, and we had 2 houses, one on top of a hill and one at the bottom. I was alone in the house on the top and texted my SO to come up there with me (cause I wanted to do the dirty), and when she arrived, we went upstairs. But as soon as we entered the room, I couldn't see anymore. Like, I tried looking around, but it was impossible for me to keep my eyes open. I tried looking around the room to locate the bed, but I literally couldn't keep my eyes open and I lost control. After that the setting changed and I had lost lucidity. I still remember what happened afterwards, but I wasn't lucid anymore.

Similar things happen every now and then, but the keeping my eyes open thing is a pretty recurring one. That and not being able to talk/losing my superpowers all of a sudden/not being able to move anymore etc.

Losing my superpowers usually doesn't last though. Like last night for example, I was having avatar-like powers (earth/fire/air/water bending) and I could fly of course, but sometimes my bending wouldn't work, or my flying would stop working, but I usually just thought to myself ""what the hell is this, why doesn't it work"" and try again and that usually solved it.

Also, how do you deal with falling in love in your dreams? Does it fuck with your head as hard as it does with mine? I was looking for a story I posted on here once, but can't find it. I once fell in love with an old crush of mine in my dreams and it seriously fucked me up for 3 days. The worst part was waking up next to my SO and being bewildered that it wasn't the person I was in love with, I was so freaked out. I told her after the feeling had faded, but it was so intense that it stuck for 2 or 3 days and really messed me up."

So when is it cool to take someone else's property? Who gets to make that call?

The society you have a social contract with.

&gt;I don't know about you, but I find rules to interfere with me more than they assist me.

This is an immature way to look at the world. Without rules you'd be dead by 30 or worse.

&gt;     

I can't get through life without dealing with other people writ large, so am I a slave to other humans?

You cant live life in a bubble so there needs to be some ground rules.

&gt;If so, then it's much fucking easier to avoid corporations than government. Hate Walmart? Don't shop there. Hate government? Try not paying taxes and see how that goes.

You can always renounce your citizenship and move to antarctica or somalia. Neither of those places have rules.

&gt;Health insurance does not equal health care does not equal health. Besides, that number is ridiculously inflated; it includes anyone who, in the course of a year, had any lapse in coverage. So, you changed jobs and went a week without health insurance? Congratulations! You're now part of this talking point.

Regardless, it's a bit of a crisis in America. We're the only first world country to have such a crappy system and it's because of our obsession with the free market. Yes, you have a point, private sctor spurs on research, but can the government sector. Government is GREAT at research if it actually puts its mind to it. Or have you totally forgot about the cold war?

&gt;As for technology, it's far better to have technology that few can afford than have none and thus no one can afford it. Over time, such technology becomes cheaper, benefitting more and more. 

False dichotomy. Balance of the two is preferable, and that's if we even NEED a balance.

&gt;Bankruptcy is exactly the right solution for someone who can't pay their debts. It was designed for this express purpose: to protect people when they got into this situation. So now that it's accomplishing that mission, we now want to say it's a bad thing?

When we can do things better, yes.

&gt;Look at it this way, if you completely equalize all healthcare in 2013, we all have equal access to 2013 technology. In 2033, we all still have access to 2013 technology. In our system, in 2013 we have unequal access to 2013 technology. In 2033, we have unequal access to 2033 technology. Even those at the lower end benefit more, as unequal access to 2033 technology trumps equal access to 2013 technology.

Once again, this is a false dichotomy. Look at the military...those men with guns. Are they using the same tech they did in 1945? Heck no! Government can research stuff too! It can hire contractors to do research! This internet thing you're on? What, do you really think the private sector CREATED it? Yes, it utilized it for its purposes, but it didn't create it. That was government.

&gt;Please, tell me how you intend to accomplish this?

Accomplish what?

&gt;I hear lots of ""I'd love to do this"" and ""I'd like to fix that."" How? I have never heard anyone with your views give me a realistic answer here.

The same way we could accomplish your no government bullcrap. I love how you act like its so impossible when I propose something, but you? Oh, yeah, well let's not talk about how we can accomplish a stateless society. Just eliminate government and it'll all fall into place."

I would assume Gazprom estimates would tend to be on the pessimistic side, but even so, there is a $2 (18%) premium using their estimates. Eastern European nations already believe it could be more competitive and will help [lower prices if exported now](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/18/caruso-driving-off-russian-aggression-with-us-natu/). 

So I guess it depends on whos estimates you use for what US natural gas will cost in the European markets. Either way, the spread is a lot closer than a lot of people think.  

&gt;My point was just that the more ""green inititive"" shit they can shove in there, the more gas they will have to buy instead of other traditional fossil energy sources. It firmly secures the market.

That has to be balanced out by what these regulations will cost back at home. Canada opposes these regulations, and is also a large natural gas producer. I would be willing to bet they oppose them because they will cost a significant amounts back to implement. 

I believe the Obama administration is truly concerned about global warming. As the largest food producer, the US will feel climate change in financial ways other nations might not. That being said, the US is feeling some of the effects of Asian pollution already. UC Berkeley did a study and found Chinese air pollution makes up ~1/3 of San Francisco's air pollution. An entire shore in Hawaii is unusable because of the Pacific garbage patch. The currents wash huge amounts of trash ashore daily. 

So even if it was for the physical effects the US is feeling from it (could be considered selfish), there are still compelling reasons for the US to want to reduce pollution. Nations all over the world are eyeing US natural gas. Europe wants a blanket approval to export it in an upcoming trade deal (instead of the case by case basis now). The US is being pressured from European and Asian nations to export more, not the other way around. In fact a lot of politicians dont want to allow more of it to be exported. As of now its 1/4 the cost in the US compared to Europe, which is great for US manufacturing. "

It's also a ""he said vs. he said"" situation with no evidence. Nationals and the police wouldn't be able to do much, except make trouble because of the underage drinking involved. 

And in my sorority, no one was sexually assaulted or raped. A girl claimed her roommate hit her. The roommate said it was bull and told the cop, ""If I hit her, believe me, there would be a mark.""

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389823622.0,"Attraction is key, of course, but it's not just how you look. And it's not exactly personality, either. I may consciously try to figure out if he's smart, funny, nice, etc., but the key is more subconscious. It's how he makes me *feel* when I'm around him. Ideally a guy will make me feel excited, somewhat shy but not uncomfortable. He will be playful, relaxed.  It's a mistake to try to impress me, because that engages my conscious judgment of him and I am super critical. I think when guys try to act ""confident"" they often come off as arrogant, overcompensating, insecure, or downright rude. The better approach is to aim to appear relaxed. It takes confidence to do that but it's a subtler kind of confidence. Basically, don't take yourself too seriously. 

The type of date suggestion matters, too. If a guy asks me to do something fun and unique, I'm more likely to say yes. I feel like I'll at least gain something from it. Movies are a big no-no. Awkward as hell. And this has been discussed recently on another thread, but I prefer that a guy ask me out and then give me his number, rather than ask for mine. "

I'm not saying I agree with him, but I don't think that the notion is very new here (at least from a minority voice) or that it needs to be silenced (that's what counter-arguments are for).

He did raise one very valid point, though. As people couple off into serious LTRs and marriage, the dynamics of friendships will almost invariably change. I am 27 and see it clearly in my social circle. It seems that all of the single people in our inner circle were more or less pushed to the periphery, and now my fiancee and I mainly just hang out with other serious/engaged/married couples. We tend to only see single friends at parties/larger get-togethers, and even then its awkward as there are usually only one or two of them in a sea of couples.

Not saying you should partner up just to fit in, but be aware that married couples tend to pull back from single friends, and its usually not intentional. "

Edit: Thank you for the sentiment, though. I simply don't believe hitting another person is ever appropriate."
OrbOfConfusion,selfimprovement,1389823962.0,"1. I just checked - I'm that skinny too. Can touch my pinky and thumb around my wrist and all that - it's ok. You can always ask a doctor about a weight-gain diet plan or join a gym or something, but I don't think you need to. You sound like you're at a healthy weight for yourself, even if it's less than others. 

2. Practice your conversations with people. Take little steps, even talking to one new person a day for a minute or two is a step forward. If you can't think of anything to say and the conversation lulls, ask a question. Keep them talking; people love to talk about themselves. When they've been talking for a while, they won't think ""geez this guy is quiet,"" they'll think ""this guy is fun to talk to."" 

3. Don't do nothing. Seriously, even if it's only a small thing, like making a list and crossing off one thing, it's better than nothing. Don't have any days where you've done nothing at all, even if the only thing you've done is a small one. It's ok. The important thing is to push yourself and make progress, even if it's slow.

4. Ask a doctor about getting medication/therapy (find which one/both works for you) for your mental health. No one should feel depressed like that, trust me, I've had two periods of depression in my life and the one thing I wish was that I'd gone to a therapist so that I could have gotten out of it faster and continued on with my life more quickly. 

It's easy to blame your parents for things, and maybe it is their fault for putting you on a bad path, but you can't walk further down that path while continuing to blame them. At some point you have to take responsibility for a lack of knowledge about life and start to fix/overcome it. 

Also, for God's sake treat your girlfriend better. It's not enough that you appreciate her, you should *show* her that every day. Don't leave so she can ""find someone better."" If she wanted someone else she'd be out there finding him. She wants to be with you, so that's the end of that. Keep in mind that at some point, no one wants to be with someone who doesn't think they're worth it, so if you go around voicing that too much she might leave, not to find someone else but to get away from someone who thinks he's worthless. And you're not worthless. You're just a 21 year old guy figuring things out. It's ok. 

TL;DR: Do something small every day - have a conversation, look up something you don't know, cross off one thing on your list. Doing anything is better than nothing. Get help for your mental state from a doctor or therapist. Seriously. There is no shame in getting help and more people than you realize either have/had a therapist. "

Well, 4 months ago, I met a man and I adore him.  We are very far apart politically (not to mention I work for the Welfare office).  We have come to the understanding that our votes just might cancel each other out, but we won't let our differences come between us, or fight about them.  

I hope we can make it work.  For some reason our differences excite me a bit.  It has been simple so far, but my friends and family all have a lot to say about it and have been extremely shocked I'd date a Republican.  I just love him!

ballepung,AskMen,1389824149.0,"While that comment comes across as a bit dramatic, I think the point he's trying to make(if you read between the lines) is that modern western women are way too picky. This pickiness comes from being raised to believe that settling down for a guy who's anything but awesome, is a waste of time. If a man doesn't stand out in a great way, he's useless. He should be able to please you in every single way, and if he doesn't, then you should immediately throw him away and look for something better.

The problem is that relationships don't work that way. Relationships are all about self-sacrifice and looking past the smaller flaws. The current selfish Walmart generation is all about what's good for yourself. It encourages you to have a long list of deal-breakers and to aim as high as possible. As a result, you end up never being satisfied.

It's no secret that women traditionally are more picky about their partners than men. After all, women are still the ""choosers"". But in the old days, women at least *needed* men, which again led to them being forced to lower their standards to what some might argue was a more fair level. Now that women no longer need men, they tend to follow their natural instincts and aim too high. This is only further strengthened by our modern culture that encourages women to be picky.

There are obviously some people out there who genuinely are better off alone, and there's of course nothing wrong with that. But generally, people will feel the need to settle down at one point. And that is why I'll never understand the fear of settling down already in your mid-twenties, when you know deep inside that this is something you want to do in the future anyways. In fact, having kids early can be a good thing! You'll have more energy to take care of them, and you'll still be fairly young when they are grown up."

noc007,DataHoarder,1389824164.0,"My initial reaction is to be very skeptical and I've never heard of them. Their paid services are substantially lower than any of the other unlimited places I've come across. Based on [this page](http://onlinestoragesolution.com/features.html) it looks like they're using [Pydio](http://pyd.io) (formerly AjaXplorer) to manage their storage. They're a brand/service of IIC Internet, which is headquartered out of Oklahoma and their site is designed the same. Per their website, they don't sell any rackspace and only sell hosting services on shared servers or dedicated servers they maintain ownership. The site seems unusually lite on details.Their address is 201 S Robert S Kerr Suite 911 Oklahoma City OK, 73102. I'm not sure if this is where they've located their servers and doubt they would do it in that building. The domain iicinternet.com was registered in 1998 (site says company started in 1997) and onlinestoragesolution.com was registered in 2004. Per the WayBack Machine, they've been selling cloud storage since 2004 (a decade and have never heard of them?); overall information on their site historically has been sparse, but they did have a [little blurb on how it started](http://web.archive.org/web/20120503220938/http://www.onlinestoragesolution.com/company.html). Personally I wouldn't admit to going to Fry's and building a system to offer cloud storage.

Based on what I could find, it looks like a small mom and pop shop. Reviews aren't that great and customer service is atrocious. Canceling service is just as painful and will probably require calling your bank to stop the charges. It looks like there's only one guy that does CS and support and his name is Steve. They have a distinct problem of migrating customers from an old server or one that is full to another server; generally all data is lost in the process. It doesn't look like they do any kind of backup of data and I haven't read one review where it actually took place. Lots of complaints about slow speed and frequent down time. I'd be surprised if it was more than Steve and Chris (the owner) doing anything technical.

If you're looking for unlimited cheap storage, BackBlaze has made a good name for themselves. They don't offer rsync or support UNIX and Linux, but it doesn't seem like these goofballs can keep shit working.

TL;DR Don't let the price fool you. Looks like a bad idea to do business with these goofballs."

In any event, the difference is that the RCC accepts that your denomination and others are Christian: we just disagree on the details. Whereas there are denominations and individuals in America who do not believe Catholics are Christian: that's all I thought OP was getting at.

hopewings,Diablo,1389824302.0,"This may be slightly out of date, but it should still be mostly accurate:
http://www.blizzcon2013.com/diablo-3-ros-primary-secondary-affixes/

In general, a primary stat can reroll into another primary stat, and a secondary stat can reroll into another secondary stat.  As long as the stat natively rolls in that slot (for example, crit natively rolls on bracers but not on pants), and it is not a special legendary affix (for example, chance to launch a ball is a special affix on hellfire rings and cannot be rerolled), then it can be rerolled/be rolled into as a new affix.  

For example, you currently have a helmet that is 200 intelligence, 150 vitality, 50 all resist, and has a socket.  You want to reroll that 50 all resist into crit chance, so you select it at the mystic, and hope for the % crit affix to come up.  This is a random process, and it may not come up right away, and it may also roll below the max 6%.  You can also just leave it at the original 50 all resist stat, if you don't get your desired stat.

The mystic screen is apparently bugged at the moment and will not show all of the re-rolling options.  This was already reported on the bug forums and should be fixed one of these days."

&gt;&gt; It tells the story of a beautiful 15-year old maidservant named Pamela Andrews, whose nobleman master, Mr. B, makes unwanted advances towards her after the death of his mother, whose maid she was since age 12. Mr. B is infatuated with her, first by her looks and then her innocence and intelligence, but his high rank hinders him from proposing marriage. He abducts her, locks her up in one of his estates, and attempts to seduce and rape her. She rejects him continually, but starts to realise that she is falling in love with him.

Wow. Do you understand that all ""transitional species"" are exactly the same as ""established species""? They all are equally valid? they last just as long? There is no boundary between transitional and established. ALL SPECIES ARE TRANSITIONAL. 

Do you understand that **this is the world where evolution took place**?   Evolution is a fact.  You just steadfastly don't bother to look at the evidence.  Evolution is not in question, despite the fact that you want it to be. 

&gt;I know this is the ratio. I'm claiming that it runs counter to the current scientific theory of evolution. 

No, it doesn't.   And please don't bother to keep restating your ideas until you have at least a shred of citeable scientific evidence to show they are supported. 

if you want to have a real debate about this, you are going to have to get some real scientific facts under your belt and you're going to have to get a better understanding of things like fossilization and ""tectonically active"".

Guys don't always realize that the boob-size issue can be just as sensitive for women as the penis-size issue is for men. I recommend that you sit him down and say that he's said some hurtful things unintentionally. Say that you've been with guys with penises that are not the same size as his and if you voiced an obvious preference for a different size, it would probably make him uncomfortable, and his comments are no different for you. Tell him that you're not blaming him, but that you would like him to start paying attention to the impact of breast judgements on women and, hopefully, learn to love your breasts as much as he has loved any pair ever, regardless of size.

It's emotional damage that others can't see. It could cripple her from having loving, successful relationships and make her vulnerable to emotional if not physical abuse when she's older.

If you skip on trying to overclock the CPU, which is difficult given your CPU cooler limitations in most mITX cases anyway, this is a fantastic option. I will admit I have an i5-3570k overclocked to 4.2 GHz in my identical case, with a radeon 7950 that didn't even fit without me cutting a piece out of the front of the case frame. The EVGA (and Asus) 760 will fit without trouble, the case has exactly 10.0"" for a GPU (of course I got one that was 10.25"" long lol). The 450W bronze power supply is high quality and has no trouble in my build, so it is more than adequate for a locked i5 and a 760, which has similar if not slightly lower power draw. Anyway this is pretty much the smallest case you can actually put a high-performance computer in for a reasonable price. I think it looks great, too. "

The hypothetical: What if a mother gives birth to a child on a deserted island (say the father, the only other person to know the mother was pregnant, had died in whatever accident stranded the mother).  If that mother doesn't love the child, and kills the child painlessly in its sleep.  Is that mother justified because there is no pain and no severed relationship?"

Edit 2: ""Myth"" was probably a poor choice of words, for all you heavy-flowers. But seriously, many guys have no idea what a period is like. And strawberry jam? How does that look anything like blood, even clotted blood?"

Pass rates have increased in the last couple of years, from around 40% in 2011, 43% in 2012 and 56.3% in 2013 and the number of students getting above 90 also increased. 

 Moreover, as far as I know, university grade entry requirements are linked to the average tawjihi marks. This year entry marks have actually went down compared to previous years.

Also, is flooding universities with ""freshman"" really that bad? Assuming the universities can accommodate them, which luckily most of Jordanian universities can, I really don't see a problem with a lot of young people going to get an education.

False.  This is conventional wisdom, but it is wrong.  The first party to make an offer will have more anxiety about it, and likely be less satisfied with the outcome.  However, assuming they are fairly competent at negotiation, they are likely to come out ahead monetarily.

Make the first offer, just make sure to do your research and make it well above what you actually want.  You'll do fine.

downvotesattractor,OutOfTheLoop,1389825385.0,"I am probably one of the few people who will say that the second matrix movie was my favorite in the trilogy. 

I *loved* matrix reloaded. I have probably watched it more than I have watched the first movie and third movie combined. Sadly, not many people really understood what the movie was about. Expectations were different from what the movie turned out to be, and a lot of people were disappointed.

At the end of the first movie, the matrix was still a mysterious enigma of sorts. A sequel to the first movie would have been expected to provide an explanation to all the events in the first movie, which the movie miserably failed to do. Instead, it just raised more questions and added more complexity to the story line. This went completely against the expectations, and the only thing left to be appreciated in the movie was the CGI.

The real story of the matrix begins in matrix reloaded. In the Matrix, Morpheus explains that it is not the year 1999, but 2199. In the second movie, you'll figure out why that is a carefully crafted lie (the real time is closer to 2799 or something), and is a small component of a much larger plot. 

You'll learn about the challenges the machines have to face in designing and building such a system. Unlike the Terminator or Battlestar Galactica which completely ignore the questions of what it takes to engineer such a system, Matrix Reloaded dives head first into it. And the first problem they hit, is a philosophical one: one about choice and free will.

The second movie is essentially all about choice, free will, determinism and the ability to control a person or an entire population around these ideas.

I don't think everyone actually *got* this part, but those who did get it, loved it. They formed a small community of hardcore fans of the Matrix, and they are still scattered around the internet today (the last time they all got together was on the day the matrix MMORPG servers shut down).

**TL;DR** There is more to the matrix trilogy than the world being just a computer simulation. The story is so deep that it got lost somewhere and disappointed audiences. But the real story is still in there if you look hard enough, and if you *get* it, it will blow your mind!

Cautiously_Curious,AskMen,1389825398.0,"Seems like a pretty terrible idea for most people. My two cents:

As a touted ""solution"" to cheating they appear less than useless, since a person who couldn't help but cheat in a monogamous relationship aint likely to abide by the rules of an open one either.

In current society, they favour women in terms of partner selection (if both partners are equally likely to seek sex). A man in an open relationship would probably have to be more secure in himself (or delusional) than the woman. This asymmetry will cause a lot of these relationships to fail. Asymmetry in something is what causes most relationships to fail.

If you're in one, good for you, but you aint better than people who are monogomous. Stop insinuating you are. Moreover, the ""monogamy is unnatural"" stuff has got to stop. It's incredibly annoying and isn't even anthropologically valid.

In all seriousness you have to be willing to spend a lot of time breeding and leveling. Usually it's easier to get the first evolution of something and raise it through all stages of evolution yourself. I recommend breeding because on the GTS there is a lot of demand for certain pokemon, and if you can breed yourself a comfortable surplus you have a good bargaining chip for whatever it is you're missing.

Another tip is that if you're somewhat stuck in a rut trying to get a pokemon you need, offer a second (or heaven forbid, third) evolutionary pokemon on the GTS.

Some items necessary to evolve are only found in the Battle Chateau, and you'll probably need to farm those on your own.

In fourth grade, I had whooping cough. My mother have specific instructions to the teachers to give me water whenever I asked, or let me go to the fountain. My 4th grade English teacher hated me, I'm sure of it. Whenever I asked to go to the fountain, she'd say to wait until the lesson was over, which is somewhat understandable. English was right after PE, so I'd need water. In the line, walking to English, I had a crazy coughing fit. I felt like I was going to pass out. I asked if I could go to the fountain which was five feet behind us. She said no. I basically begged her, coughing, wheezing, and crying. She kept saying no. I felt like I was dying, so I ignored her and drank from the fountain. She gave me detention.

In 7th grade, I was in chorus. I loved, and still love, to sing. I take voice lessons and my voice teacher says I'm very good. In 7th grade, you're allowed to try out for solos for the concerts or competitions. I, of course, tried out for them all. The teacher said that everyone who wanted a solo would get one, and no one would get another until everyone got one. I got none. Most got 2, some got 3. I tried out for the advanced singing group. I was sure I got in. I looked at the list on the door, I wasn't there. But my almost tone-deaf cousin was there. I was so upset, I cried in the bathroom. I emailed my mother telling her about it and she came to bring me home. I talked to the principal before leaving and told him why I was upset. He told me that I obviously wasn't good enough and I can't be good at everything. I cried all night. My mother believes the reason why the teacher hated me is because she tried too hard to be involved in the class. I believe the reason why so many people got in other than me is connections. The teacher's daughter is in the class, as well as her friends. My tone-deaf cousin's step-mother is the principal of the elementary school. If you think I actually did suck and was just being a wimp, I can prove you wrong. The next year, Mrs. Bitch left the school and we had a new chorus teacher. She loved my voice and my knowledge of theory. I also got into the All-State mixed middle school choir (the top 100 middle school singers in my state). The principal issued a formal apology to me.

kellykebab,changemyview,1389825649.0,"Your third example pertains to google searching, not customized advertisement. Only the very elderly and mentally addled are looking to ads for insight on political or philosophical issues.

While the Target story is somewhat disconcerting, I think most people would simply disregard the mailings that girl's parents ran across. In this case, the father accused Target of trying to ""encourage"" his daughter to get pregnant, based on the very outlandish idea that pictures of maternity clothes could sway his child's decision to procreate, carry a human life to term, and give birth. In other words, the irrational behavior of the (indirect) 'target' of advertising prompted this controversy as much as the mega-chain's promotional strategy. I think a reasonable person would have simply chucked the ads the way 90% of us do with junk mail. I, for one, can't recall a single example of an online or mailed ad that's been aimed at me in the last year. I know they're there, I just ignore them. Video ads on TV or youtube are a different story, but to be honest, the most memorable examples of those have actually been enjoyable. They didn't force me to buy anything though, so what's the great harm?

The second point is by far the most worrisome, although I have yet to hear sufficient examples of individuals rounded up for terrorist or espionage crimes on shoddy evidence obtained largely through backdoor spying. My suspicion is that although the government is collecting more information on its citizens, there is *so* much information to sift through, and so much that probably appears *nearly* incriminating (like jokes or stories), that rigorous analysis and investigation is still necessary to suss out the actual criminals.

I have to agree with /u/mmf9194's point that most criticism of data sharing involves a lot of conjecture and slippery slope scenarios. Humans are pretty adaptive and I think many situations which might sound intolerable in the abstract would actually be fairly inconsequential to live through.

That being said, I wish far more human talent and brain power went into the sciences and arts than marketing. It's staggering how great a percentage of our society's efforts are spent on hocking bullshit. To me, that's the greater tragedy.

mkvgtired,europe,1389825875.0,"&gt; That would be a good thing imo. The economic crisis has revealed as much.

Its only good if it has teeth. London especially is making sure they are as weak as possible. People talk about US banks being ""too big to fail"" but fail to realize European banks are absolutely *massive*. [Five of the world's 10 largest banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) are European. They're only getting larger. Most banking mergers and aquisitions are not in the developing world where you might think, but in Europe. A whopping 62% of all global bank mergers are in the EU thanks to the one passport system. The presumption is if both banks are chartered in the EU, the merger is allowed. I am not an expert on anti-trust, but would assume they are bound by anti-trust regulations but that is about it. As I said, the numbers speak for themselves. A very large majority of all global banking mergers and acquisitions take place within the EU, so these massive institutions are only getting larger. 

The City definitely is where bad money goes to play. American banks do all of their international lending out of London. There is far less regulatory oversight. My professor for ""International Banking and Finance Law"" (Masters of Law course), worked for a Chicago based bank, was licensed to practice law in several US states, but spent most of his time working for the London branch (he worked in international lending and syndicated loans). He even said ""London is an old boys club if one ever existed.""

&gt;Can you elaborate a little bit more on this? Are US laws on issuing securities very strict?

Yes. Despite what you hear on reddit, they are some of the most strict (probably the most) in the world. Europe has thresholds that allow a company to avoid disclosure for an issuance. So companies just structure each offering so they effectively have to disclose very little or nothing material at all. New European regulations were originally much more in line with SEC rules, but the UK got their hands on them. Now its very easy to avoid disclosure, which is not the case with an SEC offering. SEC rules aside there is an incentive to over-disclose in the US because shareholders have the right to sue an issuer if they make a material misstatement or material omission. This is far from the case in Europe, and even less now with these new watered down rules. 

This is only securities. Dont even get me started on relaxed banking regulations now that regulatory authority is being centralized. A new single regulator is still in the works, so lets hope they dont let London screw around with its authorities too much. 

If so, it can be a very productive endeavor, if not, things could be fairly destructive. Given each of the two largest banks in France both have assets equal to the entire annual GDP of France, European banks are truly ""too big to fail"". Just two banks have 200% of France's annual GDP in assets. That was one of the reasons France was downgraded. Because their banks had such high exposure to toxic European sovereign debt (Greece, etc) and ratings agencies anticipated government intervention in the case of another crisis. 

In that sense I agree a strong regulator would be great, but given the past exercise in centralization, I am not sure that is what we will see. Given the amount of deregulation already, I worry about how countries would go about bailing out institutions that eclipse their own national economies, at least in terms of total assets (although keep in mind not *all* assets would become worthless, but if enough did at once, like in 2008 in the US, it could cause a pretty catastrophic crisis). It could end up being like an Iceland crisis, except without other countries to dump the financial burden on. 

This does not even get into problems of banks having monopolies in other countries. For instance much of the burden for a financial crisis in Latvia fell on Swedish banks and the Swedish government.

The next day, I go to the Comcast torture center to pick up my replacement DVR and find out they had shipped me a new modem with a land line and router built in. I never signed up for that shit! And my bill was back up to $153.95 per month! The service guy offered me a 2 year contract that would allow me to move service without a cancellation fee, but would include this land line, with TV and internet. When that was all said and done, my bill would have been $160 per month. I cancelled service right then and there, went home, and called Comcast. I now have the introductory rate with the fastest internet and HD DVR with HBO for a year. $119 per month. I then went back the next day to pick up my new DVR and modem again. Their website said it was open until 9PM, but it was actually 7PM. Fuck Comcast. Okay, so the next day I went back again. The guy that meet with me before was working and looked right at me as I walked out of the store with the same equipment I had just canceled to his face the other day.

p3ndulum,TheRedPill,1389826061.0,"By [request](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1v8cc0/a_woman_cannot_tell_you_how_you_must_proceed_she/ceqghse) (to increase visibility), my response to /u/ThePragmatist42's [downvoted reply to OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1v8cc0/a_woman_cannot_tell_you_how_you_must_proceed_she/cepuhqd):

&gt; Neither you or OP are necessarily wrong, but what I think what you're missing is the fact that men come from an **active** and **strategic** world view and women from a **passive** and **responsive** world view.

&gt; So, for example, when a guy asks a woman for relationship advice, what he's really asking is ""what are the things that I can *do* so that I can (effectively) [have sex with you]?""

&gt; Because a woman is passive and responsive, having almost no idea what it's like to have a strategic mind, her experience tells her that all a person needs to do is just *be themselves* and a relationship will just *happen* to them - because that is generally how relationships happen to *them*.

&gt; When a woman is approached by a man she is attracted to, to her it just feels like the a Hollywood, reached-for-the-taxi-door-handle-at-the-same-time moment, where this Prince Charming just popped up out of nowhere and *boom*, there's chemistry - and a great romantic story to tell her friends. That's why they hate ""creeps"" - because they're not capable of giving her a fairy tale love story encounter. And that's why she hates pick-up artists and Red Pillers, because - at least in her mind - they/we're not ""being [ourselves]"" or being ""natural"".

&gt; When a woman is giving a man relationship advice, she is effectively trying to tell him ""just have the universe align you in a completely organic and natural 'romanitic' situation with a woman whose friends will think you're the perfect guy"", because that's what *she* wants to experience (solipsism).

&gt; Because her worldview is *passive* and *receptive*, she doesn't understand that a man is looking for step-by-step owner's-manual-like instructions on how to get a woman to fuck him. To her, either a man is just *plugged in* or he isn't - and if he's looking for instructions, he must be undeserving of it or broken in some way (a ""creep""). She would say ""just be yourself"" because, d'uh, that's what all the guys she dated did and it worked out fine for *them*. (More solipsism.)

&gt; From OP's title: ""A woman can not tell you how to proceed."" **That's strategy, and women are followers by nature and don't know how to lead/can't wrap their minds around the concept from a strategic perspective.** ""She can only tell you what she want to experience."" **That's because of her passive/receptive worldview. She can't tell you how to create the experience she wants to experience, she can only tell you what she wants it to look or feel like for HERSELF.**

&gt; This is why women become irrational/passive-aggressive. When their realities don't match what they want it to look or feel like, they begin to play the role of the victim - because they only see the world from a passive/receptive point of view, which what OP's translations are trying to illustrate.

&gt; To build on what OP said about when she says ""I'm a good person"", what she's (not) saying is ""I want you to *think* that I'm a good person because 'good' people are treated better and people like them, and that's how I want *you* to deal with *me* so then that may become my reality.""

&gt; She very well could be a *terrible* person, but because (again) she is passive/receptive, she can only follow your lead, not having any real clue how she might act in the future (good or bad) because she won't know until she has actually responded and then had a chance to reflect. (Even though her ""hampster"" will always rationalize that she didn't do anything wrong/it wasn't her fault/she was just the passive victim who was taken advantage of.

&gt; In the case of ""I want to be independent"", what she is really (not) saying is ""I want to be *thought as*, as well as *spoken to* as if I'm independent, even though I actually rely on the state/other men - whether it be financial aide or just by them playing along/not suggesting otherwise.""

&gt; Women basically spend their entire lives in fairy tale/make believe mode - it's like everything is a game of dress-up, with the hair and make-up, always ""pretending"" on some level, but don't really know it.

&gt; ""Pretend"" is their reality.

&gt; ""Women and men are equal.""

&gt; ""If men can do it, we can, too.""

&gt; High heels, push-up bras, breast implants, fake eyelashes, often being referred to - and even regularly referring to themselves as ""princesses"".

&gt; So when they are communicating with men, especially, it's always from a place of ""I want you to play along.""

&gt; And as soon as you're *not* playing along, they *feel* like you're no fun, or a ""loser"", or a ""creep"", or a misogynist.

&gt; They are a princess, after all, there'd *have* to be something wrong with *you* if you didn't like her or agree with her or validate her for some reason or in some way.

&gt; And therein lies the difference between men and women.

&gt; Men mean what they say, and women say what they want to feel or experience, ala OP's post.

&gt; ""You must be a woman-hating misogynist if you don't agree with feminism, because women are passive/receptive, so anything that you don't like about them must be because of something you or (probably) other men have done. So it's *you* who needs to change, not women.""

&gt; It's why just about everything men say and do is ""sexist"" or why they don't like it when men have an opinion about women - it's because it's often out of line with the fairy tale they want you to create for them.

&gt; It's also why they enjoy flirting so much. Flirting is always suggestive and vague and indirect.

&gt; Anyway, this has just turned into a stream of consciousness because I keep having epiphanies while I write this, so I'll just end it here."

radeky,TrueAskReddit,1389826221.0,"To start: There are plenty of change.org petitions for net neutrality.  Find those rather than starting a new one.

Regarding the various points:

Against Net Neutrality: The internet is not a singular item, but rather a mesh of providers, content providers, consumers and combinations of the three.  Additionally, it is not a required utility, and should not be regulated as such.  Specific content providers and users use a very large proportion of the available bandwidth, and as such providers want the ability to charge them more of a ""per use"" cost, rather than the flat rate being provided now.  Also, certain classes of traffic are already prioritized, namely VoIP and other ""real-time"" classes, that need to show up in order.  Lastly, we already restrict items on the internet that we find abhorable (bestiality, child porn, etc) and this is just a continuation of that.

For Net Neutrality: The UN classifies the Internet as a basic human right, meaning it should be regulated like utilities.  The internet is a global utility, and restricting net neutrality will result in a competitive disadvantage for American enterprises and entrepreneurs.  Currently a large portion of the American network infrastructure is controlled by companies who are both service providers, but also content providers competing against other providers.  This results in a disincentive for them to ""play fair"" if net neutrality is not upheld.  Neutrality is part of the defining characteristics that allow democracy, ideas, etc to flourish and prosper.  Restricting that endangers a lot of the political freedoms [insert slippery slope argument here] we enjoy.

Those are the basic points.  The internet providers, particularly the ones that also control/are controlled by media companies are wanting to be able to prioritize their traffic to their customers to provide a better level of service while restricting traffic for things they dislike.  Bittorrent being a large piece of it, but also possible Hulu/Netflix as they hurt their businesses.

Proponents of Net Neutrality are worried about slippery slope situations, where we restrict more and more, essentially cutting off freedom of speech, etc.  Also, they maintain that because the internet is a need, that net neutrality is a key component of that need as a vehicle for political expression, etc.  Lastly, allowing content providers to set the rules for what speed content can be delivered fosters an unfair competitive advantage for internal companies, and puts the US at a competitive disadvantage when dealing with international companies."

As far as the additional pressure on your teeth goes, don't worry about it.  There will be times where it seems like the braces are moving your bite in weird ways or making some of your teeth crooked, but your ortho knows what he's doing.

guakelerotk,AskReddit,1389826310.0,"My science teacher was a pretty memorable, and newly qualified teacher. She was quite young, so she was sort of a bit more smarter pal. We liked her a lot, because she was a person you could open up to.

One time during one of her lessons she started talking about one time she got bitten by a tick. She hadn't noticed and as we all know - ticks can carry deceases. 

She got a reaction two years later, and it was pretty bad. She told us that she had to go on really heavy medication, which would make her getting pregnant impossible. On the other hand, if she quit the medication, to get pregnant, she would be in so much pain that she couldn't complete her pregnancy. 

So she could never ever have a child. 

This was something she told us out of the blue, and is for me, one of the most memorable thing from school. The thing is, people forget that teachers aren't teachers *all* the time, so her speech came as a shock, because we couldn't comprehend that she actually was a person with a life outside school.

The trend from B/W has been that it affects breeding, so hopefully it stays that way in X/Y. If you're feeling frustrated remember how fortunate it is that the shininess ratio is the highest it's ever been in this Gen, and don't give up! 

As friendly advice, I'd recommend breeding natures, too. It'll definitely pay off if you want to have a competitive/semi competitive team (and from IV breeding it sounds like you do!)

MeMyselfandBi,AskReddit,1389826520.0,"The human lifespan will either be doubled or be infinite thanks to improvements in artificial intelligence.

Treatments for serious conditions, illnesses, and genetic disorders will be exponentially improved.

There would probably be people living somewhere other than Earth, but it probably won't be as significant as science fiction has projected.

Entertainment will probably be offered in new mediums. However, entertainment would most likely be delivered with shorter duration times.

Technology would probably be more linked together.

The majority of the world's population would be atheists.

Robotics and computers would take over most unskilled labor jobs.

The average work week would be cut down to be an average of 21 hours a week but with many hours outside of work involved in performing tasks for the career.

Transportation would be much faster, with alternatives to air travel being seen as more cost effective.

There will be less currencies used due to efforts to rid old currencies of inflation.

The most prominent currency would be a currency not associated with one particular nation or union.

Open displays of nudity and sexuality will be seen as less taboo.

Marriage will be seen by many as archaic.

Artwork generated by means outside of traditional styles will be less prominent in museums as postmodern techniques, such as graphic design and computer-rendered art, will be exhibited in museums.

New houses being built will have interconnected technology built into the walls to make managing the house much simpler.

Individuals will be encouraged to forgo individualized talents to perfect multiple talents in one or two fields. This will allow for one person to do the job of what many people do today, thus decreasing cost and eventually increasing salaries. 

Because less people are needed to perform multilayered tasks, smaller projects will be able to compete with products funded by larger corporations (a trend which we can see the inception of today).

Movies are so prevalent that ""home theaters"" and MOD are common distribution tactics used by major production companies to cut the cost and limitations of movie theaters.

Certain tentpole movies will be presented on 360 degree screens in theaters built like futuristic colosseums.

Cybernetic recreational drugs will enter the black market.

Colleges will reach a plateau of profit leading to alternative higher education being established.

Cigarettes will become as illegal as heroine is today.

Alcohol will be stigmatized to the point that future generations won't care as much about alcohol. They in turn will replace it with extreme sugar/caffeine alternatives in which the long-term effects won't be discovered until they are treated for psychologically-conditioned disorders associated with their addiction when in their centurion years.

Psychological health will take precedence over all other health scares.

Warfare will inevitably become more focused on the psychological aspects of it, as world leaders realize that with the more connected world and with the general public distaste towards violence, plus with medical treatments catching up, the most effective option is to condition your enemies from with their countries's citizens.

Words and sentence structure will alter in order to promote brevity of speech.

Books will become more serialized as the average page number per  book decreases. This will lead to subscriptions towards online publishers and bookstores that will be equivalent to today's Netflix.

Pop culture trends will change so rapidly that taking a day off from following them will result in being, in today's standards, one year behind the trend.

Retirement wouldn't happen until a person is between the ages of 160 and 190.

The internet will be replaced by a multinet of sorts that will arise from a constant fear of information exposure. Despite this, connectiveness will reach levels so large that people will be able to have normal romantic or close relationships from across the globe.

Standards of beauty will change to involve more body modifications but less of an average height and more of an average weight.

A large portion of the food market will be dealing with artificially altered or generated food.

Some people will partake in lifevlogging. This will entail recording all aspects of their life, even sleep, through many cameras and mediums. There will be controversy over this for some time until it will inevitably help in some criminal proceeding. Many parents will find issue when their child reveals that they have taken upon this ""lifestyle"" and there will even be books, movies, and even documentaries surrounding the phenomenon.

Driver-less vehicle travel is the norm as it eliminates most errors associated with manned-travel.

Environmental beauty becomes paramount in urban planning as people become more fixated on brighter living environments.

Entire walls in households will be dedicated to on-the-second updates and information.

Some people spend the majority of their adult lives in isolation but communicate virtually with thousands of people.

Some people will experience a condition first coined as ""reverse motion sickness"" in which they develop headaches from being docile for too long.

Food, being more readily available than ever before, will have value based on its time of consumption efficiency.

A new letter will be introduced into the English language.

Most people will be speaking more than one language and be writing in one computer language.

Artificial intelligence will reach a level so close to humanity that people will have online friends that are AIs and they won't even realize it.

Parents will begin the practice of creating a real ""imaginary friend"" from birth. This AI will grow up along the child and adapt its looks to what the child sees as non-threatening. Essentially, we might see a Calvin of the future create a Hobbes.

Most clothing is gender neutral in style. Skirts of been adapted to the point that both men and women wear the new designs.

Technology will be incorporated into clothing.

People will have personal bluetooths to help find them if they are missing but to also give them information on things they pass outside.

Technology will be incorporated into housepets and petcare.

Because of energy scarcity, scientists will finally find a way to utilize the power from the sun in a significant way.

GeeJo,Parahumans,1389826903.0,"* **""Stranger""/""The Stranger""** (*Master*) Unless paying very close attention to what their bodies are doing, people in his immediate vicinity begin to absent-mindedly harm themselves - one hand breaks the fingers of the other or gouges out an eye, teeth bite down on tongues, legs shift their weight onto ankles until they snap. Victims are unaware of the damage they're causing themselves until he leaves the area, by which time they're generally crippled in one manner or another. Could focus his power to make it harder to resist at the expense of a narrower area of effect. Elderly bespectacled man who dresses like a funeral director. Deceptively friendly and entirely willing to hold a genial conversation while he watches you repeatedly stab yourself in the kidneys. Would almost certainly feel right at home in the Slaughterhouse Nine.

* **""Takeover""** (*Master/Stranger*) Class-S threat. Sister of **Geas**. She too can overwrite people's minds with a copy of her own personality and memories. Unlike her brother, the possession is temporary, but anyone she possesses also *gains the ability to spread the possession to others*, making for an expanding circle of threat. Once they recover, the victims are immune to both her ability and that of her brother, so she has a habit of getting them to commit suicide while she still can. Her original body was eventually killed, but ""outbreaks"" of possession continue to take place across the world. One of the greatest threats to global stability out there.

* **""Taser""** (*Striker*). Point-blank electrokinesis. Default setting is ""stun"", but can amp up the power to lethal levels at the cost of becoming increasingly drained. Can't turn the power off entirely, so she typically wears gloves and concealing clothing most of the time to avoid accidental static shocks. Caucasian, a relatively devout Muslim convert. Somewhat aloof, meticulously dodges questions on how her power affects her love life. Major, major character until she became a victim of **Assassin** after spurning his advances (probably for his own sake as much as anything).

* **""Tasp""** (*Blaster*) Inspired by the namesake device from Larry Niven's *Ringworld* novels. She could induce incapacitating pleasure in people from a distance. Was eventually killed by a sniper (looking back at these, guns were a really huge equalising force in the setting).

* **""Twitch""** (*Brute/Blaster*) Meth-addict, utterly immune to pain but not to damage. Superhuman strength. Telekinetic when enraged, but otherwise not. Part-time enforcer for a few different gangs, ended up as an experimental subject for **Plague** since no-one would miss him. In Brockton Bay would certainly be involved with the Merchants.

* **""Victor""** (*Thinker*) Something similar to Contessa's power, but he could only use it once per day and the answer to whatever question he asked was only stored in short-term memory. Had to balance out tactical uses (winning a fight) with strategic uses (writing down the bones of a plot before he forgets the details). Nordic in appearance - tall, blond hair, blue eyes, muscular. Gay, with zero tolerance for homophobes.

* **""Violet""** (*Shaker/Mover*) can control friction of surfaces within line of sight, causing people to slide around helplessly or be stuck in place with their feet essentially glued to the floor, drop weapons, soil themselves, etc. Tentatively adding the ""Mover"" category here as she was often the team's primary mode of transportation. A more versatile power than you might think. Player Character.

* **""Voodoo""** (*Master/Tinker*) Can animate small dolls with a range of abilities and intelligence. Can also modify/create dolls for unique effects. Loner-type, some hints of sexual deviancy (some particularly creepy dolls).

* **""Wildcard""** (*Stranger/Thinker*). Can swap bodies with his target if they don't resist too hard. Powers stay with the mind, meaning he could then swap out of his new body into a third, putting Target B into Target A's body. In effect, anyone going up against his powered gang (**""The Wild Cards""**) had no idea which bodies corresponded to which people/powers, and the situation continued to change throughout the fight as the team was well-accustomed to rapidly shifting around. Had a brilliant tactical mind - enough so that he'd probably qualify as a low-level Thinker. I remember one ""quest"" involving them, centered around a new gang-member who was put into a much more handsome/rich team-mate and didn't want to return to their own body. When he made a break for it, Wildcard hired the players to track him down and return him unharmed. Something of a ""loveable rogue"" character. As I recall, Wildcard was eventually run over by a truck (piloted by **Hijack**) while inhabiting someone else in a Whedonesque ""Wham"" moment, leaving the rest of his gang trapped in each others' bodies (bonus side-quest fixing that situation). 

* **""Xe""**/**""Genderbender""** (*Blaster/Changer*) Forced transformation, swapping a person from one biological sex to another or to a ""neuter"" form. Causes significant but not absolutely debilitating pain in the process. Normal effect lasted about a day, but xe could increase the duration at the cost of exhaustion - only one ""permanent transformation"" per day, and only if there wasn't much else going on. No-one's sure what xyr original gender was, and xe seems comfortable as either. Very popular within the trans community for obvious reasons. Had a side-gig helping out in Witness Protection for those willing to try something different. Insistent on using the pronouns demonstrated in this blurb, to the point of refusing to talk with anyone unwilling to use them. Player Character who remained a background NPC after the player got bored and moved on.

Enjoying this gen seems to be hit or miss for a lot of people, and I'm guessing it's because of differing ways of gameplay. Do you know if you actually want a 3ds/2ds? Do you think you can handle buying a new console only to have it run technology that isn't brand spanking new? A good friend couldn't deal with the quality of the console and stopped playing X, but he's 1 of like 50.

Do you think you'll play for the story? Do you want to be a part of the competitive aspect of the game, or do you want to just catch cool looking things and beat the Elite 4? There is a LOT of replay value for the former, and a pretty high drop out rate for the latter. 

I don't know what your financial situation is, but unless you can just drop $200 on a whim and not worry about it I wouldn't get this gen unless you were certain you'd play it through to the E4.

Fuck that, he was an abusive, dead beat drunk. If you care so much you give the guy a funeral.  I had him cremated and scattered the ashes along the beach he grew up on.  I wasn't a fan, but he was still a man, you know?

That said, if I hadn't been legally obligated to do so, I don't think I'd have done a damn thing."

TryUsingScience,Norse,1389826973.0,"I don't think you can have it both ways. Either Mjolnir is a normal hammer in which case Jarngreipr must be magical or he wouldn't need them, or Mjolnir is a magic lightning hammer and he needs iron gloves to not burn himself. Normal hammers don't require a specific set of normal gloves to wield. Also there's the part where Mjolnir resurrects Thor's goats.

""Thor's favourite traveling companion"" is a kenning for Loki. Thialfi is one of Thor's servants, not one of his friends. There are stories where Thor is mad at Loki but I can point to just as many when they travel together happily - the visit to Utgard-Loki, the Lay of Thrym where Loki helps him get back Mjolnir, the original forging of Mjolnir which Loki was responsible for, etc.

I'll buy that Thor doesn't personally use magic outside of his magical items, but I don't see convincing evidence for Thor actively disliking all forms of magic.

The crossdressing has nothing to do with the runes. As I said, runic magic doesn't make one ergi. Odin crossdressed to learn magic from the witches on the women-only isle of Samsa. And again, seidh is not all magic and not all magic is seidh. It's perfectly reasonable for a straightforward warrior like Thor to dislike seidh since it is full of trickery and scary stuff, but there is plenty of magic other than seidh.

Edit: Just remembered another story, where Thor goes to a seidhkona to get a rock removed from his head. So clearly he *is* okay with that kind of magic. It's just not manly, which is why Odin gets crap for using it."

There's a perfect example at the top of this chain where the top mod of /r/iama - /u/karmanaut talking about the process for verifying AMAs.

Tons of philosophies for how to mod large subs - unmoderated queue vs. /new vs. how to configure automoderator to minimize the tedious work so you can focus on more important tasks, keeping things under control with so many users and recruiting mods from the community to help as the subreddits grow and making sure that they do what they are supposed to be doing, CSS changes, etc, etc, etc.

For example if someone posts about some moderator engaging in cheating or spamming on reddit for profit, my $.02 is helpful because I dealt with a really similar situation.

There's really just a lot more than the spam filter and banning idiots. How to handle modmail, the direction of the subreddit, policy making/figuring out rules, and then specific things that certain mods are very good at/specialize in like I mentioned.

&gt;In diplomatic terms there are three types of war.

&gt;Hot War : this is actual warfare. All talks have failed and the armies are fighting.

&gt;Warm War : this is where talks are still going on and there would always be a chance of a peaceful outcome but armies, navies etc. are being fully mobilised and war plans are being put into operation ready for the command to fight.

&gt;Cold War : this term is used to describe the relationship between America and the Soviet Union 1945 to 1980. Neither side ever fought the other - the consequences would be too appalling - but they did ‘fight’ for their beliefs using client states who fought for their beliefs on their behalf e.g. South Vietnam was anticommunist and was supplied by America during the war while North Vietnam was pro-Communist and fought the south (and the Americans) using weapons from communist Russia or communist China. In Afghanistan, the Americans supplied the rebel Afghans after the Soviet Union invaded in 1979 while they never physically involved themselves thus avoiding a direct clash with the Soviet Union.

I was looking for a new game, and it was on sale on steam for dirt cheap, so I picked up the bioshock 1 and 2 bundle.  I knew that it was a shooter with some science-magic ability mixed in, but that was about it.  It was incredible to realize what it was actually about, the setting, and everything.  I actually have a pretty intense fear of water, especially drowning in it, so the atmosphere was perfect for playing off of that fear for me.

I can be, I just choose not to when someone is being a smartarse. 

&gt; If you can't see the sarcasm of his post, again perhaps this isn't the job for you

I can see sarcasm, hence the reason I didn't report him. I figured he reported it just for shits and giggles

&gt; Furthermore since the website cannot provide information on who hit report you have no basis whatsoever to accuse him. You just don't have anything to go on but a hunch, which turned out to be wrong. 

He said he did. Do you get annoyed when cops arrest people for admitting to a crime? As I said to him, he said he did, and there was a report on it. What would you think?

&gt; So either you need to improve the report function

That would be a job only the admins could do

&gt; If theres one thing that won't fly it's a power hungry mod. My advice to you is to just drop it and move on. Keep pushing it and you will easily find the community turn against you

Lets use IVs as an example. You can have 0 or 31 IVs for any stat, and obviously you want as many as close to 31 as possible, because 31 points makes a difference. The more the better!

Looking up [Sylveon's Base Stats](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sylveon_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)#Base_stats) you can see that at level 100 her Special Attack (her highest offensive stat) can be anywhere in the range of 202 to 350. That's a difference of 148 points! That's like almost 5x as important as IV breeding.

A pokemon can only have one stat maxed out to 100%; my first well bred pokemon (5 IV Dragonite) has a Jolly nature, meaning that he has a lower than average Special Attack and a higher than average Speed. Coupled with EV training his speed stat is the highest it could possibly be in game; mainly because of his nature.

Triplanetary,books,1389827550.0,"I enjoy this [hit piece about Oprah](http://www.newsweek.com/why-health-advice-oprah-could-make-you-sick-80201). It's not entirely about The Secret, but it does go into Oprah's fondness for The Secret, and it also elucidates The Secret's inherent self-centeredness:

&gt;On one of the Secret shows, Oprah gave an example of the scientific power of the concept. She said that once, while she was hosting an episode about a man who could blow really big soap bubbles, she was thinking to herself, ""Gee, that looks fun. I would like to blow some bubbles."" When she returned to her office after the show, there, on her desk, was a silver Tiffany bubble blower. ""So I call my assistant,"" Oprah told the audience. ""I say, 'Did you just run out and get me some bubbles? 'Cause I got bubbles by my desk.' And she says, 'No, the bubbles were always there. I bought you bubbles for your birthday and you didn't notice them until today'.""

&gt;There are many lessons that might be drawn from this anecdote. One is that if you give Oprah a thoughtful gift, she may not bother to notice it or thank you for it. This is not the lesson Oprah took away from her story. Because the way she sees it, her assistant hadn't really given her the gift at all. She gave it to herself. Using the power of The Secret, she said, ""I had called in some bubbles."""

* W-Q combo is not, in fact, an instant kill (with, in fact, strictly less damage than a Q-E build at 6) and not even 1200 range (less than 1000 with level 1 W, at 1000 with level 2).

* You do not even have to get close to a tower to kill with Q-E build, because you will be doing more damage than a W-Q build and they will die before or shortly after your root wears off.

* The E block actually scales with level, at 6 it blocks 200, at 8 you'll block 500.

You're right about the camp stacking allowing you to get quick flash farm with your E, which is a point in favor of the build, not against it; once you have battlefuries it works well with your W as well, though by the time that matters you'll have all of your skills up to 4 anyhow.

Anytime man! I'm always here if you need advice but don't have the time to make a whole post about it. 

This is how *I* do it. 

Sit down with her on the couch. Look her straight in the eye. ""Let's watch a movie. Pick one."" go to on demand if you have it.

**What kind of movie to watch?** 

2+ people: horror movie/scary movie. STRATEGICALLY POSITION YOURSELF. She needs to have a barrier on one side (AKA end of couch) and you on the other if we're going horror movie. Comedies are the best way to go. 

My favorites: Hangover, Superbad, **Anchorman**... 


**Kino** 

Now I sit down next to her. I make an excuse to get up, sit down, and put my arm over the top of the couch behind her. Like I'm putting my arm around her, but my arms on the sofa frame. It's like hover hand, for your arms. 

At the first sign of an IOI we open fire. Pull some kino stuff- play fighting, nudging, etc. and if she shows IOI from that right as you're ending your kino move make it that you've shifted out of place then just slide your arm down around her. 

**How I go for the kiss**

If you're feeling the vibe, you think she's feeling it, if there's a boring ish part, turn to your head and look at her. When she turns her head and looks back, smile. Look down at her lips, then just move in 90% of the way. She should go the last 10%. 

**IF SHE DOESN'T ACCEPT THE KISS?**

If she turns away or something I just pull back and say SIKE! and continue **unfazed**. Act as if there wasn't anything awkward that just happened if she rejects your kiss.

gravvs,books,1389827777.0,"The people who love the book the most never went to college or are in community college right now. They got into the book through Johnny's character.

I'm in college so almost all the people I interact with in the day to day have read a lot of humanities papers and are familiar with academic articles. They tend to like the book because they're used to reading so many articles and producing so much academic work.

But in general it's probably one of my favorite books and usually something I throw out along with other recommendations to anyone I'm talking to just to see if they're interested in it. But that always comes with the warning that it's weird and super hard to read.

If I'm talking to someone with a wide range of literary knowledge, and especially if they have any literary/critical theory I'm guaranteed to bring it up. 

But I think it appeals to two types of people. People who have been serious fuck ups at one point or another and people who are in a liberal arts education. 

I'm a lot of both which is why it appeals to me so much. 

I think that going into the book you do have to a certain attitude. You can either give the book the benefit of the doubt and play along. Or you can reject everything as confused and gimmicky. 

If you look at the opinions of the people who took the second option it's clear that they missed the boat on most of what the books was trying to accomplish.  

I think that it's totally fair to dislike the book. It's certainly not for everyone. But I don't think it's it's fair to dismiss the book. "

EtherBoo,insanity,1389827866.0,"Hi there.  Best of luck to you when you go to start.  

&gt; I travel to a nearby city 1 or 2 days a week (Friday and Saturday) 

Make your off-day Saturday, so your ""Day 1"" will be Sunday (I always start my workouts on a Monday).  This means your rest day will be Saturday.

&gt; where I won't have any space to do Insanity, while having access to a gym.

Is there no room in the gym?  I've seen hotel gyms (not sure what kind of gym you're going to) with small aerobic spaces that can be used.  Just bring your laptop and go to town.  If you only have a tablet, let me know and I can post instructions on how to rip the DVDs for viewing on a tablet.  Most big gyms will have an aerobic area, and if you're not there during peak hours, you should be able to get a space for yourself.  

If you're in a hotel, I've managed to do Insanity in a hotel room, so it's doable if you're creative.

&gt; are there any parts of the insanity week that I could forgo 

Well, if you make your rest day Saturday, you only have to miss 1 workout.  In that case, I would basically chop Wednesday's (or Tuesday's in your case) workout out.  This way you get 2 full days, Recovery, 2 more full days.  It's a bit more symmetrical than 3 full days, recovery, 1 full day.  The only exception is I would make sure you don't cut out any Cardio + Abs days.  If you have a Pure Cardio + Cardio Abs day on a Wednesday, swap it out and cut a different one out (whichever workout is on that week twice so you don't miss anything).

&gt; for standard weight lifting 

Insanity is not a strength based workout like P90X - there are no weights (unless you got the Deluxe edition, but the weight workout is supplemental and not on the schedule).  So, you wouldn't be working towards the goals Insanity is setting you up for.

&gt; and cardio (treadmill/bike machine/running/elliptical)?

Insanity is much more than Cardio.  The bike, elliptical, treadmill, etc only work 1 set of muscles.  Insanity works multiple because of all the different movement types.  I used to spend an hour on the elliptical and barely hit 100 Calories burned.  With Insanity, I burn 1000 calories a workout.  It just doesn't compare, but something is better than nothing.

Hope this helps."

Tiki_Lamp,AskReddit,1389827874.0,"Maybe others have a different experience than yours, which is, of course, a very shocking thing to think. Maybe depression is something that they didn't always have, so they've actually experienced what it's like to find enjoyment in things that they no longer do, which makes the difference between the two even more apparent.

You cope with a lack of emotion and a lack of enjoyment. Good for you. Like seriously, though, good for you. However, other people aren't as lucky, or as tough, or as capable, or whatever it requires. Other people aren't wired the same, don't live the same life, and aren't in the same environment as you.

Also, don't take this as an insult, because I don't mean it as that even though the accusation carries a negative connotation, but I feel like what you're describing yourself as is sociopathic instead of depressed.

basically your scarf makes a a short cut for people to know you hold certain values and beliefs, and if they don't share them they will naturally try to gravitate towards people who they think do.

Guys may think that if the girl has no confidence, it is because she is not the ""best he can get"". It is also important that both people in a relationship have an equal power over what happens in the relo and pedestalling can mean that this equality doesnt take place.

TLDR - It damages relos when there is a huge power difference and may subconsciously lead the guy to look else where."

silverionmox,europe,1389828111.0,"&gt; Not checked, Europe has many barriers to real labor mobility, namely language barriers.

So has China. Let's break it up.

&gt;Not checked. The cohesion funds are not nearly enough to offset the imbalances. They also don't work to solve problems like the current crisis.

The ECB has, after much handwaving and trying to evade its responsibility (courtesy of the austerity bloodletters), finally acknowledged that its duty as a central bank is to be the lender of last resort. The financial turbulence around the Euro calmed down after that.

&gt;Not checked. They don't. For instance, central Europe tanked during the dotcom bust, the periphery didn't,

So the periphery was catching up at that time, converging the EU economy.

&gt;ECB started an easy money policy to help (mainly Germany) contributing in no small part to the housing bubble in Spain and other credit bubbles in the periphery.

We've had no inflation, even brushing with deflation. The money hasn't been easy enough yet (though the banking union is intended to increase the velocity rather than the quantity, to tackle that problem from another angle). Individual countries have the competence and the tools to direct investment money to housing or elsewhere, that's not something the EU can determine; it's their own responsbility. That being said, there are still a number of countries with a likely housing bubble, including Sweden and the UK - both non-euro countries.

&gt;During this crisis it was the reverse, the periphery tanked, the ECB didn't act fast enough to help because central Europe was doing fine.

slayfire122,Justrolledintotheshop,1389828211.0,"I purchased a 2004 Subaru Forester XT last March with 99k miles. I had a mechanic look it over and everything looked good. About 2 1/2 months after I bought it (2,200 miles), I took it to the Firestone on base for it's *First* oil change. I was going to change the oil myself after that. It felt like it ran a little better and the oil was a dirty they said. I then took it for a drive when this happened. I was pushing it a little harder than one would normally drive though. I heard a horrible sound (obviously) and called for a tow truck (Less than 15 miles after the oil change.) I had less than a year in the Air Force an didn't have any money to fix it so it sat there for about 3 months. 


   Once I had the money and parts, a friend and I started tearing into it. When we dropped the oil pan, we saw the bottom rod bolt was unthreaded about 1/2"" and the top was barely more than finger tight. It had the coloring of conventional oil usage as well (it has the same engine as the '06 WRX and needs synthetic). The wrist pin was ripped out of the piston and the rod was wedged against the cylinder wall.

bendvis,explainlikeimfive,1389828222.0,"A hex color is a combination of 3 (or sometimes 4, if you're also including transparency) pairs of hexadecimal digits.

For example, 0x3A87FF defines the red color as 0x3A, green as 0x87, and blue as 0xFF.

Each color can be a decimal value between 0 (0x00) and 255 (0xFF), 

(0x preceeding the number tells you it's a hexadecimal value.)

The best way to wrap your mind around the difference between hexadecimal and decimal might be to look at an example.  Say we're looking at the number 483 in decimal (base 10).

483 = (4 * 10^2 ) + (8 * 10^1 ) + (3 * 1^0 ).

The same digits in hexadecimal (base 16) would look like this

0x483 = (4 * **16** ^2 ) + (8 * **16** ^1 ) + (3 * **16** ^0 ) = 3075

Fortunately, hex colors are usually only 2 hex digits long, so they're much easier to figure out.  From our example above: 0x3A87FF


In Hex, 0xA = 10, 0xB = 11 ... 0xF = 15

0x3A = (3 * 16 ) + A  
0x3A = 48 + 11 = 59.  

0x87 = (8 * 16) + 7 = 135  
0xFF = (15 * 16) + 15 = 255  

The maximum value that 2 hexidecimal digits can have is 255, so our example color color has 59 / 255 red, 135 / 255 green, 255/255 blue.  Mix those colors together where black = 0x000000 and white = 0xFFFFFF, and you'll get a nice medium/light blue.

For a long time the connection between these actions was not understood, and the begging part was thought to be as necessary as the seeding part.

dakru,AskMen,1389828487.0,"&gt; In general though men are seen as more shallow than women, and their preferences are seens as shallow.

On top of this we seem to have this idea that women's attraction is a moral force for good in the world, i.e. the idea that the most important thing for attracting women is being a good, caring, kind person and that if you haven't succeeded at attracting women, you must have been an asshole. That's how people turn men expressing their frustrations about being seen as only a friend into ""you must have been an asshole! nice guys are really just assholes in disguise!""."

The reason that they wanted to implement it was because the town itself had a share in a local power plant - they owned a fraction of the power produced by that plant in collaboration with several other cities.  However, the town itself owned more power than it required, so it exported a great deal and made a fair amount of money by doing so.  They wanted a Smart Grid to increase the efficiency with which they could tune the ratio of power used/sold, and so increase revenues."

I'm on the fence about medication, I've heard horror stories that it makes for becoming zombie-like. I'm already severely apathetic and almost emotionless, I'm not sure if medication would help that.

 It really isn't my business, but the reason I don't think it's appropriate to bring it up is more because, as you said, she's embarrassed and feels that I will think less of her. I only see her as stronger because of her pro-activeness and care for herself, even if she will never know. It's gonna show in my attitude towards her. 

I struggle with making the connection that her medication actually means improvement. I realize this consciously yet it doesn't really play out that way in my head. It doesn't matter though, just glad she got help.

EDIT: What's the modern viewpoint on anxiety running in families? I've heard conflicting evidence, but it seems like it is strongly inherited. Unfortunately, mental illness runs in both sides of my family: alcoholism, depression, alzheimer's, anxiety, bipolar disorder. Yikes!"

First, we should describe what Sn1, Sn2, E1, and E2 reactions are.

Sn1 and Sn2 are Nucleophilic Substitution reactions. This means that a Nucleophile (which we will generically call Nu- for now) seeks a ""+"" center (Our Carbon in an R-group), the nucleophile will displace a Leaving group (our generic leaving group we'll just call -L). Sn1 and Sn2 reactions are different in the number of steps, and the location(s) of our Nucleophilic addition.

E1 and E2 are our elimination reactions. Again, we have two different mechanisms for Elimination, but one of the results of our elimination reactions is the formation of an Alkene (the double bond between two Carbon atoms). 

So our first step is to figure out which reactions are a substitution rxn, and which ones form double bonds (elimination rxn).

I'm pretty sure that majority transgender people do not lie and tell them before the relationship goes any further but I know a few who have kept it secret and their partners find out later and they just feel betrayed and violated.

This was an unpopular opinion because I was told it's like wearing a ""badge that identifies your kind.""

I'm not saying that their first words to the person they meet should be their identification.  I'm saying you've got to tell them at one point, especially before intimacy, and this should become the norm.

&gt;Fair enforcement of this rule necessarily forbids bringing up GW posts because they are the same type of personal information as bringing up other posts in a user's history.

You're missing the point. Saying ""they posted in GW"" is not the same as ""Their post in GW combined with this other picture suggests they live in town X, and work in location Y."" Your method would arbitrarily ban anyone who looked at your post and said *anything* about the contents. The rule covers posting of personally identifiable information. In my example above, where someone extrapolated personal details from randomly posted images, ***and posted about it***, the rule would indeed apply, regardless of their source for the details. The fact that you can't see this disturbs me greatly, as it suggests a degree of fundamentalism about your argument.

Th3MadCreator,css,1389828975.0,"Not CSS, but PHP. give me a second to type out a basic form and PHP scrit for you.

Okay, so here is the basic form:

    &lt;form action=""process.php"" method=""post""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""name"" placeholder=""Name.."" /&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""email"" placeholder=""Email.."" /&gt;
        &lt;input type=""submit"" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

This will be the processing script 'process.php' for simply echoing out what the users entered:

    &lt;?php
        $name = $_REQUEST['name'];
        $email = $_REQUEST['email'];

        echo 'Your name is '.$name.'&lt;br /&gt;'
            .'Your email is '.$email;
    ?&gt;

In order to create content based on what they enter, you'd need a template file and bit longer processing script.

Create a directory called 'template'. Inside that directory create a file called 'template.php'. This is the basic code for that page:

    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{title}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    
    &lt;body&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;Your name is {name}.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your email is {email}&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

Note the curly brackets, they're important for the processing script to properly work.

The script for creating the content based on user input is as follow:

    &lt;?php
        // Name variables
            $name = $_REQUEST['name'];
            $email = $_REQUEST['email];

        // Generate random string for new file
            $rand = substr(md5(microtime()),rand(0,26),10);
            mkdir(""/"".$rand.""/"");
            $index_dir = ""/"".$rand.""/"";

        // Data array time!
            $data['title'] = $rand;
            $data['name'] = $name;
            $data['email'] = $email;
            $placeholders = array(""{title}"", ""{name}"", ""{email}"");
        
        // Template variables
            $tpl_path = ""/template/"";
            $tpl_file = ""template.php"";
            $tpl = file_get_contents($tpl_path.$tpl_file);
        
        // New file with replaced contents
            $new_member_file = str_replace($placeholders, $data, $tpl);
                // This replaces the 'placeholders' using the data array in the file 'template.php'
        
        // Rename new file
            $new_file_name = ""index.php"";
        
        // Write new file with new name
            $fp = fopen($index_dir.$new_file_name , ""w""); 
            fwrite($fp, $new_member_file); 
            fclose($fp);
            if(!$fp) {
                die(mysql_error());
            }

        // Redirect users to new file
            header(""Location: $index_dir"");
    ?&gt;

That's the script to write the new file based on what the user has input. I'll save this for now so you can see it, but I'll double check it after I post it. If you have any other questions, feel free to PM me!

EDIT: Changed/added a few more things. I added a way to redirect the users to their new page, as well as the oh-so-important *making of* the directory....which I originally forgot to add. xD"

BrooksConrad,OutOfTheLoop,1389829024.0,"Knee-jerk response to your point about the ""underground naked rave"" (henceforth UNR): 

I think the UNR, and the intercut awkward sex scene with Neo and Trinity, was shoved into the film as another heavy-handed thematic point. Machines don't understand community spirit. They don't understand mob rule. They don't understand love, or lust, or the communal buzz of a huge rave.

Y'know that intense rush you get in a big crowd on the dancefloor, the hot cloud that spreads through your body and strips away higher thought in favour of moving furiously to the rhythm of the crowd, of being part of the pack? Or the hormonal impulses your body gives you when you're coupling with someone, that desperate drive to stimulate yourself and your partner more and more?

The machines don't.

I think the UNR was shoved into the film to demonstrate the humans being humans, and not machines, in the most basic ways it's possible to be humans: By gettin' down and dirty en masse. It was applied with the same heavy-handedness that plagued the sequels, but as far as I'm concerned, the reason for its inclusion was valid as a counterpoint to the sterility and lack of emotion portrayed by the Matrix scenes of the film."

That, or the realization that history existed long before the time period you've lived in and most likely will continue for thousands of years after you...so saying when a philosophy ""ends"" (or declaring a result of  the democratic experiment in 2014/your lifetime) is kind of an exercise in futility.  Just as you lump ""democracy"" into a span of 300 years, one day people will look at 2014 in the context of ""The 21st century"" or ""The internet age"" just as you lump 1197 into ""the age of kings and empires"". 

 ""Democracy"" isn't over, and you and I most likely will never see if it ultimately works or doesn't.  One generation, or century for that matter, is not a good sample size when we're talking about the history of Civilization.

On the other hand, the setting in RE5 was extremely bright.  It felt like everything was very well lit, and the atmosphere of the game just felt different.  Shiva in RE5 made the game feel less solitary, and while you had a companion in RE4, in RE5 the companion had guns and could fight for herself or even help you significantly, which took much of the tension out of the game.  

Also RE5 went beyond some of the traditional RE stuff and progressed into silliness.  Boulder punching is the best example of that.

ballepung,AskMen,1389829225.0,"&gt;  I know plenty of single women in my life who have been told to lower their standards.

That might be because women are ""the choosers"". It's still very much the case that guys chase women, and women get to choose who they want to fuck/date/marry. A guy needs to be clearly better than his peers in order to enjoy even a fraction of the luxury that the average woman enjoys. And there's tons of research to support this.

Seeing as women hold so much power in the dating game, it makes more sense to ask them to lower their standards. The main difference between most single women and most single guys, is that society will see it this way: the woman is single because she wants to. The man is single because he's failed to capture a woman's heart. Even if this obviously isn't true in all cases, that's how the general opinion is gonna be.

An average  guy can search for years and never be able to get an average girl. An average girl wouldn't be single for long if she settled for an average guy. Sadly, she rarely will, seeing as modern society encourages women to be picky and selfish.

In these 6 games that *asshole* was probably on the enemy team. When someone wins a game he tends to not pay much attention to the struggles the opponents probably faced. You won your lane 7/0 and feel amazing about it. But when one of your teammates loses his lane 0/7 all hell breaks loose. The rages and complaints about the troll starts. Maybe you didn't play amazing to go 7/0. Your lane opponent was probably the troll everyone hates. But because you won, probably stomped, you didn't notice the enemy troll.

http://www.americanbar.org/groups/domestic_violence/resources/statistics.html

As far as domestic abuse, yeah domestic abuse is talked a lot about in the context of feminism, but you're wrong about the numbers being 'roughly equal'.  I think that the number of men who are victims of domestic violence is higher than more people would guess, but women  are still disproportionately affected.  For example, 'In a 1995-1996 study conducted in the 50 States and the District of Columbia, nearly 25% of women and 7.6% of men were raped and/or physically assaulted by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or dating partner/acquaintance at some time in their lifetime'. 'In 2000, 1,247 women and 440 men were killed by an intimate partner'. -- Check the source above. 

I'm not sure if I would call that roughly equal. Domestic abuse in general is an issue for all human beings, but because it disproportionally affects women, it's considered a feminist/women's right issue. 

Also I can't think of any feminist who would agree that women are 'always disadvantaged'.  And as far as addressing male disadvantage, I don't think it should come as shock to you that feminism isn't pushing hard for men's rights, considering that the literal definition of feminism is 'advocating for women's rights (on the grounds of equality)'.  Feminism isn't meant to cover everything.  Feminism is a small subset of humanism -- it's a specialisation that focuses on women.

And honestly, the claim that 'feminists have bigger fish to fry' is quite legitimate.  Focusing on getting rid of the few advantages that women have (custody for example) takes time/money/attention from much bigger issues such as rape culture, pay inequality, the glass ceiling, reproductive rights, ect.  I think that before feminism can address the advantages that women have, women need to be on a much more equal playing field than they are now.

And honestly, so many of the problems that men's rights is fighting for is a result of ideas that have been perpetuated the patriarchy throughout history (and still linger today) and is indirectly addressed by feminism.  Again, when we talk about the preference for women to be granted custody, a big reason for that is because so many of us have perceptions of women that are, to be honest, pretty sexist.  Obviously it's not overt sexism, but a lot of the ideas about women taking care of children, raising them and nurturing them, being homemakers and knowing how to take care of kids betters are internalised from a young age and are generally a result of patriarchal gender roles that have restricted women to rearing children and taking care of the home for pretty much all of human history until about 50 years ago (and that's really only in western, developed countries).  So when a court is deciding where to place a kid and have limited knowledge about a couple, they tend to fall back on gender roles and preconceived notions they have about different 'categories' people, consciously or unconsciously.

So when feminism focuses on equal pay, breaking the glass ceiling, and changing our ideas about gender roles, that perception (homemakers, taking care of children, gentle, nurturing) tends to lessen and so do a lot of other issues that male rights activists complain about (for example, one issue is that men are the only one's who have to sign up for the draft, whereas women don't have to.  Feminism dismantling ideas about women being weaker/fragile/innocent and general putting women in positions of power (which demonstrates that women don't all match the above definitions) makes the draft applying to everyone over the age of 18 more likely))

So while these issues aren't addressed directly (because they mostly focus on problems for men and feminism is school of thought for advocating women's rights, not mens) that doesn't mean that they aren't affected and addressed indirectly.

&gt; Right now this forum feels very fetish-special/heavy, and if that's how it's intended to be used, it's of no consequence, but I'd love to have a community of awesome people of all sorts of interests and walks of life--who also just happen to get really turned on by incest. We're not messed up, perverted, predators, etc. We've just got a kink that happens to be a taboo, but for the most part, we're all otherwise normal.

I meant to add up the National Child Abuse Hotline number, I know people in this sub don't like thinking about that side of things (most anyway) but it *does* happen and I know that some people could land here on accident, needing help this sub isn't qualified to give them, and I'd hate for them to not seek help if they just assume that incest isn't wrong and that they should just accept what's happening to them. 

This sub *is* very fetish heavy but there have been quite a few posts from people sharing their experiences about being abused/raped, and for the most part, people have been very understanding and replied nicely to those people. Kind of a time and place for everything. 

&gt; Links to documented incest in history/media might be nice, both in the human realm and animal realm. Especially to show how it's common in some animals, and historical. (Not to mention Biblical.) That could be a whole undertaking of its own, but I'm always fascinated to read that sort of thing.

Not a bad idea. Maybe in a few days one of us could make a post asking for articles or sources and we could put the answers in the wiki. I don't have time to search through things to find all of that, aside from people I already know about, but it's a good idea.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1389829479.0,"Communication is key to addressing the anxiety - I suggest trying to talk to her about it in a way that is non-accusatory and focuses on your own issues. Something like, ""I tend to worry a lot about pleasing my partner in bed - is there anything I can do for you to make the sex even better?"" Have a long, detailed conversation about each of your desires, your favorite positions or sex acts, etc. The more you know about her, sexually, the better you can please her and the more you please her the less anxious you'll feel. 

The third point is the toughest, unfortunately. With me and my BF, it was less about the sex itself and more about trust issues surrounding sex. The first and most important step was that he understood it was a problem in our relationship and that it was not a problem caused by me, but instead by his own issues - basically by saying, I know your sexual history doesn't make me any less special to you because the way you behave towards me shows that you care deeply about me.

 The second step was framing the conversation in a way that was productive: instead of saying, ""sex must mean less to you because you've had more partners than I have"" he says something like, ""I'm feeling a little unsure about how things are between us - how are you feeling about the relationship?"" This opens up a discussion where I can reassure him a little bit without feeling judged or attacked for my sexuality. 

Finally, at some point, he just had to learn to deal with it and you will too. Your GF should be open to discussing this and reassuring you, but she's not your therapist. If this is a pattern of though that you can't control and it negatively affecting an otherwise healthy and good relationship, you might need to step things up and see an actual therapist (ideally a sex-positive one) for a session or two to help figure out what's going on.

What we did was intentionally get started by using a vibrator and lots of communication, once we'd both been able to orgasm a couple of times using a vibrator we were more comfortable with the idea of getting there with one another, and it was easier to get there without assistance.  Now I can usually give her 3 or 4 baby orgasms and an epic several minute long orgasm every time we have sex.  Its still a lot harder for me, maybe 1 time in 10 I can actually orgasm, and outside of one glorious night never more than once, but we talk about it and make sure that we are both having fun and don't put too much pressure on getting there, and she's okay and won't feel bad if I'm really just in the mood to have an orgasm and grab a vibrator from the night stand to use on myself while we kiss and cuddle."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389829729.0,"I have nothing against casual sex in principle, but my experience is that the sex is better when you are in a relationship. I hooked up with a couple of guys for casual sex in college and it was just too hard for me to let loose around them and enjoy the experience, not because I felt ashamed of what I was doing, but because I was inexperienced, tense, and self-conscious. It takes some level of emotional connection for me to get over those feelings. I was really surprised and somewhat disappointed to learn this about myself because I had developed all these ideas about how laid-back about sex I was. I don't judge other women for being promiscuous but I do notice other women in my peer group who seem to have false expectations of casual sex, like I did, and getting hurt because of it.

hersinisterurge,raisedbynarcissists,1389829765.0,"In my opinion, lack of empathy does not equal unawareness of action. As an added bonus, the fact that they derive pleasure from what they do overrides the preference of right over wrong...but that doesn't mean they don't know the difference. They absolutely know and anyone that insists NPDs don't know what they're doing has trouble dealing with the concept that someone they've loved has hurt them on purpose, or they aren't educated on the topic- but I know even professionals sometimes want to hold steadfast to the comfort of the idea that the kind of evil that travels down to the bone is reserved for psychopaths and serial killers. That isn't true, it's more commonplace than we'd like to believe. I think that the difference between non-PD abusers and NPDs is that while the non-PDs might exhibit abusive behavior, they're exercising a lack of self control due to rampant emotions (still not a good reason...), NPDs *go out of their way* to hurt us because they genuinely enjoy it. They don't have abusive episodes, it's a way of life for them. They see the destruction they cause, right in their living rooms, and in the workplace. They do it because for them, seeing the destruction *is the payoff.* They scheme, scam, sabotage, lie, and manipulate, everywhere they go. That's an awful lot of complex stuff to do unintentionally or without solid will- while seeing the cause (their actions) and effect (our pain) right in front of them- without the knowledge that what they're doing is 'technically' wrong...they won't ever see themselves as the scum they truly are, that is true, and in that aspect reality is altered for them...but as far as knowing what is widely accepted as wrong, they know, they just don't care. They may feign this babe in the woods crap, or fake remorse when the one thing that hits home for them is brought to light: loss of control, or loss of you as a plaything. It's a ploy to convince you to perpetuate your own abuse by allowing it to happen, under the guise that it isn't intentional."

hopewings,Diablo,1389829883.0,"&gt;So a mainstat/Vit mempo has the chance to re-roll Vit into crit?

Yes, you can reroll a primary stat such as vit into crit, as long as it is on a slot that can already roll crit like a helm.

&gt;Is it possible to re-roll 2 different stats.

No, it is not possible.  You can only reroll one stat per item, and once you reroll that stat, you are locked into only rerolling that stat further.  When you go to the mystic again, the options for other stats will no longer be available, only the stat you have already rerolled can be selected."

ladieaupair,legaladvice,1389829912.0,"You're liable for the mortgage note until the house is sold, refinanced in solely her name, or if assumption is done to remove you from the note. You may have signed a quit claim deed which quits your physical right to the property, but you are liable for the note from here on out. If you want to preserve your credit, pay the mortgage. See why she's not paying - if she can't afford it, check with your bank to see what options are available to you. If she wants to try to keep the home, try to pursue a loan modification - there's a slight credit impact, but much less than a foreclosure, short sale, or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. If a modification doesn't lower the payment enough, try to pursue a short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure - those are more of a credit impact than a modification, but much less than a foreclosure sale. 

It doesn't matter that the divorce decree gave her 60 days to refi - if the bank won't do it, the bank won't do it. There's nothing the court can do there. 

So, here's my advice:

1. Talk to your ex wife - see if you can work towards an amicable solution for a short term arrangement if she can get back on her feet.

2. Call the bank. See what your options are. They are usually willing to help you. Do this after speaking with the ex wife to see what she'd like to do. I've worked on a few cases where the person with the house wants to keep it, but can't afford to - person who lost the house wanted to do a short sale to salvage the remainder of the credit, but the person who was awarded the house did all in their power to prevent a short sale from going through, i.e., refusing to let the bank's appraiser into the home to value it, removing sale signs from the yard, etc. Try to work through this as amicably as possible with your ex."

This thread is chock full of generalizations about men, and their behavior as if we all just act exactly the same. The reason I said it wasn't a fair point of view is, because it makes the assumption that all men are just going to bail at the first sign of trouble and pass the buck when it comes to parenting. You reinforced that idea yourself. 

I don't claim that men have it harder than women when it comes to children. I know better. What I have a problem with is this common perception that aside from donating sperm, men have no sense of responsibility, or ability to contribute. 

The thread itself is flawed in that it forces a sexist point of view regardless of side. The question becomes is it a flaw of society then, or a flaw of nature? After all we don't get to choose our gender when we are born. I personally know a couple of single fathers that would argue the point that they have taken on more of the responsibility of raising their child after the child was born regardless of what the mother went through in labor. I won't speak for them, but the point is still valid. Being a single parent would suck regardless of gender.

I like the idea of egalitarianism and humanism and both can each effectively address issues of social inequality in their own ways, but I don't see anything wrong with narrowing down those two very broad subjects into different subsets.  Women's rights and men's rights are ultimately aiming for the same goal (gender equality), but they don't need to be combined to work.  "

He probably also feels guilty about this legitimately, regardless of what everyone else here is saying. Perhaps he needs to be slapped in the face with it. But realize that if he is depressed, and he very likely is from the way your post sounds, you should be careful how you confront this situation. Perhaps suggest he see a therapist.

TofuRobber,ShouldIbuythisgame,1389830182.0,"It's been a while since I last played this game but I'll try. I won't spoil the story but you might want to find out these game mechanics on your own; unless you don't care, then, read on.

There are no random battles. You see the monsters out on the field and can choose to fight them or avoid them. 

Navigation in the game is pretty straight forward. You are given a minimap and have to traverse through segmented maps of an area to proceed. There is no world map (that I'm aware of anyways). That means that most places aren't too big. Maybe 10 screens max per area (excluding small rooms) granted each can be fairly large on their own. The maps are also made in a way that they still allow you to explore them (both town and field/dungeon maps). This also means that there will be places that you are unable to backtrack to.

You can pick up side quests (actual missions) throughout the game. They seems to be pretty straight forward. They probably won't add depth to the game but will add width and they are needed to get 100% completion I believe. There are collectables too (if i remembered correctly) if you like those kinds of things. You can examine objects in the world for items.

A fun thing is the market. It's works on an upgrade system. You collect items throughout the game (mostly through battle) and can use them to upgrade the stores that you use to buy everything (weapons, armors, accessories, items). The upgrade improves all shops in the world and not individual places. It's pretty important to regularly upgrade the shops but it's not that hard to keep it current with the level of the enemy that you are fighting. You can even grind early on so that your equipment will always be better than necessary but I doubt that you'd really need to do that.

This game is honesty fun to play. As I mentioned, the battles were the things I liked the most. Beware though, fighting in the same place too long will make battles boring and repetitive. I suggest you don't grind too much and move on with the story at a decent pace to help keep a challenge. Upgrading the shops were fun too but I can see how it can become a chore much latter in the game. From my impression, I don't think this game will entice you to want to play it. For me it was a game that I had to want to play to pick it up but that's a personal preference. "

Montuckian,technology,1389830413.0,"GM isn't a great example of a company that does well on SM.  Very few people are going to click through and buy a car, which is what this channel gears itself toward.  Additionally, very few people are even really looking to engage in this way with vehicle manufacturers in my opinion.

The fact that you didn't see GM take their budget and run over to LinkedIn or Twitter is testament to the fact that it's a channel issue not a platform issue.

If you're in an ecommerce-based business however, Social, and Facebook in particular, can be very lucrative.  If your demo is what Facebook has, then can very often produce extremely high ROAS compared to other platforms, especially other display platforms.
  
This is not to say that FB performs better than Google Display, [it objectively does not](http://www.wordstream.com/articles/facebook-vs-google-display-network), but when you take the 900lbs Google gorilla out of the room, Facebook looks a whole lot better.

And really you're comparing apples to oranges; Google and Facebook are two totally different things.  Advertisers don't decide whether to spend on Google or whether to spend on Facebook, rather they decide what to spend on Google and what to spend on social, of which Facebook generally takes the lion's share.  And it's for a simple reason, namely that even with Google being as large as it is, it's still very possible and common to reach the point of diminishing returns.

And what advertisers are facing at this point is that there is no social platform that performs as well or as consistently as Facebook when viewed purely through the ROAS lens.  Yeah FB reporting sucks, sure it's over monetized to the point of diminished reach, and there's definitely discontent and abandonment going on, but at the end of the day it still generally produces more and better conversions than its competitors."

JorddyK,mentalhealth,1389830421.0,"Absolutely! I couldn't agree more. I'm one of those people that spends time researching mental illness and medicine in general. It fascinates me and I've been planning since I've been very young to choose a medical carrier. For these reasons, I've never had even the semblance of a stigma against mental illness. 

I just sort of want to talk about this and I've seen such genuine care on this subreddit. I'm just going to add some background information and some of my opinions:

Mom grew up in the 80's, a time where mental illness was still widely stigmatized. Her uncle, who has the most severe case of bipolar disorder I have ever seen, still hasn't gotten treatment. His parents who instilled those attitudes in him have died, his remaining family urges him to get help often, yet it's all in vain because he still carries those stigmas. I feel that she may feel the same type of embarrassment. Perhaps on a lesser scale, but it's there. 

This is possibly unrelated, but an incident happened years ago ( I want to say I was 12, I'm currently 16 and turning 17 next week) that may have contributed to her embarrassment. She and my dad were on vacation (I think, this is a really foggy memory) and the topic of depression and anxiety came up. He simply said something to the effect of ""Anxiety and Depression are just excuses weak people make to rationalize their weakness"". It didn't sound as eloquent or convincing as that, but it really was said at the wrong time in my life and has clearly stuck with me. He passively said it again within that year, and has since seemed to look at the facts and change his point of view. Even after this, I still cant shake this incident. My dad is an amazing father, my childhood was close to perfect with barely (if any) problems at home, but it really stuck with me. I wouldn't admit this anywhere else for fear of being judged, but that *really* bothers me to the point where it hurts to think about it. "

There is vast disagreement about how many people the Earth can support, and that number is not easy to figure out because we can't guess what science and technology will come up with in the fairly near future. Some people believe that we already passed the tipping point at 7 billion. Some people believe that quality of life would suffer, but we could conceivably support 20 or 30 billion.

In any event, the current projection is that we will reach 9 billion in another 30 years or so, so stick around and you'll find out.

Clearly there is some number when it becomes unsustainable, though, even if we don't know what that number is. We do know what happens when we reach that number, however: famine, violence, disease, death.

That's when I felt it. Something large and leggy squirming around in my mouth as it drowned in the deluge of milk. I gagged and spewed it all onto the floor and promptly screamed upon seeing the cockroach that had decided to turn my cold milky beverage into its personal swimming pool.

The definition of theism is that you DO believe a god exists.

An agnostic theist thinks that a god exists, but accepts that they don't truly know that they do, and that they could not exist or that there could be multiple gods.

An agnostic Atheist believes there is no god, but accepts that there could be one(or more) but they don't have reason or desire to believe in them until their existance is proven.

So long as it doesn't make them hurt other people I say let them do it.

As for needing it, I'd like to point out that some folks do have legitimate medical reasons for it; for example, my friend's father has a stunted appetite, and uses marijuana to stimulate it so he can actually eat.

dkbuzy,melbourne,1389830784.0,"Depends on so many variables your head will bleed from the math.
CoP (coefficient of power) is the best way to tell, it is the measurement of electricity consumed vs. cooling produced. Anything with a CoP of above 1 is power efficient to a certain extent.

Roomies (window rattlers we call them) have the compressor contained in the same box as your evap coil so even though the pipe runs for the refrigerant is shorter the heat the compressor releases is bled on the the coil twice through the refrigerant and through the air in the box so there is loss in there.

A split is has all the hot stuff out side and the cool stuff inside so from a refrigeration stand point it is more efficient but you are powering another fan motor and some more circuit boards.

Roomies are really still made because they are so easy to install, most CoP figures come out in favor of the splits, especially with inverter technology and more efficient refrigerants. Most manufacturers don't research roomies any more, I am sure they could be made more efficient if there was enough demand for them but there is not."

Quidagismedici,AskMen,1389830902.0,"I don't think it's discriminatory, I just think it's a pointlessly limp approach. On the one hand I sympathise 100% with the desire behind it to see sex-work made safe &amp; I agree that those involved ought not to be punished, particularly in cases of coercion &amp; economic necessity. But how much safer are you really if you still have to conduct your work out of the law's sight? It's all very well being open about the fact that you sell sex, but if you want customers you're still going to have to conduct your business in secret if they're at risk of prosecution for it.

Of course, I see the benefit from the point of view of getting justice for sex-workers against whom crimes are committed by clients, pimps etc., since they can then go to the police without fear of repercussion, but what good is that if the law is forcing them into shady situations to begin with?

As for whether the client is doing something morally wrong, I simply don't know.

I underwent emergency surgery, and spent a three and a half weeks in the hospital, with follow up surgeries and a staff infection. I got out of the hospital on June 8th, and made it to the graduation ceremony on June 9th. I have the diploma up on the wall of my room at my parents' house still. I keep it as a sign of my accomplishments and a reminder that if I could survive what I had to go through that month, I could survive anything.

Kzickas,FeMRADebates,1389830955.0,"&gt; We're not interested in having to defend our own terminology every goddamn thread. Sure, you might have quibbles about the use of the word ""privilege"" or ""patriarchy"". But they're descriptive terms, not normative ones - and academic pursuits are entitled to terms of art - and I'm fucking tired of writing endless explanations of this to people. It's not fun, it's not interesting, and it's exhausting. Besides, based on my own experience in this sub, you probably don't actually have a problem with the terminology, but with the theory the terminology is used to discuss. It's a big difference.

Academic pursuits may, but in politics, and gender politics is politics, you have absolutely no right to demand that anyone accepts your framing of issues. There are many times I agree with feminist claims according to feminist terms as explicitly defined by feminists, but still disagree because the connotations of those term creates a framing of the issues that I disagree with. In a political debate words like ""privilege"" and ""patriarchy"" are very much normative"

The lowrider thing came to me from a fault with PD's wheel/tire graphics. You can increase wheel diameter and change the wheel appearance, but you cannot change the width of the wheel/tire and you cannot change the tire sidewall (with a few exceptions). So I went to do a +2 Torq-Thrust on my ElCo, but the skinny tires stayed skinny and the whitewalls stayed white. It looked like shit.

So I looked at the baby moon steelies, didn't like em. The wires won out. Then for shit n' giggles I dropped the back end down, picked the front end up, and maxed the front negative camber. This is the end result!

manisier,AskReddit,1389831019.0,"Er, regarding Christianity, that isn't what it's about. The whole point is that you're saved from hell, therefore you do good things out of thanks and reverence, not that you do good things to avoid hell.

""Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God."" Romans 7:4 ESV

Following rules will never get you into heaven, as far as Christianity goes, anyway. And for what you're saying, the Bible says something about that too. 

""The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. And he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God."" Luke 16:14-15 ESV

Context: the Pharisees were a bunch of Jews that were really, really good at following the law. But Jesus points out that they only did that to look good in front of others, and that they hoped to get into heaven just by obeying God. But God knew that they weren't being genuine, so they weren't really being good at all.

Great point, by the way!"

ZapActions-dower,gallifrey,1389831133.0,"No, no, they say that there is 400 years between the last hours of the War Doctor until when Eleven meets him.  Which makes Doctors Nine, Ten, and Eleven up two that point have a combined lifespan of 400 years, with Eleven having the majority of that time, plus another 900 years (approx.) afterward.  

Four is, according to Romana who corrected him on his age since he lost count, 759, Six said he was around 900, Seven said he was 953, and then Nine said ""900 years of time and space,"" and Ten said he was 903.  So, clearly something is going on here.  It's definitely possible that the post War Doctors started counting their age based on their first travels with the TARDIS rather than when they were born on Gallifrey.  For one, Gallifrey no longer exists, and secondly it makes the numbers line up nicely.  If we assume Romana to be the most correct source here (and I don't see any reason why we shouldn't) then her count of how long he'd be travelling in the TARDIS at the time (523 years) would put the age at which he stole the TARDIS at 236.  So!  900 plus 236 makes Nine *actually* about 1136 years old, and Eleven at the time of the Day of the Doctor around 1500 years old, and after the Time of the Doctor, Twelve is regenerated at about 2400 years old.

This gives Eight and the War Doctor 183 years between them, which is a pretty good amount of time."

p3ndulum,TheRedPill,1389831198.0,"In the grand scheme of things, this community is still in its infancy having only been established, what, twelve months ago?

It's like the damn is breaking and water is beginning to rush in in terms of they level of consciousness among the men who come here.

This is a huge group full of frustrated people who are are just starting to figure things out - the percentage of those who *get it* is only fractional compared to those who don't fully understand yet - so those who are making contributions are still trying to refine their craft, so to speak.

I'm sure that if you left the community and came back in 3-5 years, the percentages will have polarized, where you would see fewer and fewer frustrations being expressed and, instead, much more civil discourse.

All of this ""woman hating"" is nothing more than growing pains.

What I think often gets lost in all of this is the fact that each and every one of us really truly wishes we had better relationships with women - and so we've come here, either serendipitously or because we've searched it out, because the information and advice we've received our whole lives has worked against us. And part of the process of learning how to walk again starts with a painful rehabbing process.

Also, in OP's defense (in repsect to *your* perspective), very few of us ever actually have the whole story - and even when we have most of it, things can get lost in the translation from what we think we know and being able to express it in a communicable way. Which is why it can sometimes take more than one person, and even sometimes more than one attempt, to communicate any specific concept or idea.

Consider that I didn't really understand the things that I initially responded to you with until *after* I read OP's post. Information is funny like that, and that's why we form communities, so that we can all throw our pieces into the pot, and then build the moasaic as a collective.

So as far as the members who expression their frustration with women go, it's not the point of the community to come here and complain, it's just an early part of a maturation process. And as far as the contributors go, they are all pioneers and martyrs in some ways, trying to break new ground for a generation of boys and men to come - so that they might grow up in a world where they don't have to deal with so much of their own frustration."

ChipSteezy,changemyview,1389831280.0,"You should never rely on a subreddit to form your beliefs (Except maaaybe CMV). You should be cautious of what I'm writing now. These boards are highly biased in their beliefs, and usually each thread is composed of bullshit that the OP spouted off the top of his head five minutes beforehand. I'm looking at you TRP, SRS, MRA, and /pol/. Each of these communities are usually filled with a good number of users who have spent too much time on their respective board, and think that they're right. They spend so much time buying into their board's beliefs, that they never consider the chance of being wrong. And when their views are criticized it usually results in buzzwords being thrown around until one of the users decides that they're wasting their time.

I'm not trying to imply that each of these boards only has crazy users, and edgy teens as their community. A lot of users on SRS, TRP, MRA, and /pol/ are very knowledgeable, and normal. But on the other hand, a lot of users are so self righteous and self important with their ""beliefs"", that it gives the entire board a bad rep. Do you think users of MRA, TRP, SRS actually do anything to further their cause in real life? I bet the most they do is scoff at their friends when they say something that sounds beta (for a lack of a better term), or misogynistic, or feminist. Even if they decided to start protesting in real life, do you think the average user would have the attention span to stay with their cause, that they have found on an imageboard? And do you think, that they would ever make a difference either way?

In my honest opinion; I think that SRS isn't so bad. They're clearly the most sane board out of this list. I actually am subbed to them, and I find a lot of the posts, and comments to be funny. And I think they brand themselves as feminists for teh lols. But I don't agree fully with everything they say, and I don't think any SRS user minds that. In fact I'm sure that they'd advocate free thought, that is reasonable. You certainly won't find me SJWing people on reddit, and any SRS user who has read the sidebar on /r/shitredditsays wouldn't either.

I don't have an opinion on MRA, really. I've heard a fair share of horror stories, and I don't intend on visiting their sub reddit any time soon. 

TRP is my least favorite of these boards. First of all, why is it even named The Red Pill? What is supposed to be the truth that will be revealed to me here? And what's so shocking about it? And why is it limited to picking up chicks? I think that you'll find the most crazy user here, the one who spends so much time in believing the Red Pill theory, and these users are usually so dramatic, and brash about their posts. I don't want to discredit the TRP theory, because I've never really considered trying it, but I find it unlikely that an ALPHA would be browsing reddit at all.

And I know that you didn't include /pol/ in your original post, but I thought that they're also an important board in this topic. Imagine /b/tards, MRA, TRPers, a bunch of self proclaimed nazis, and the average person who believes in conspiracy theories are mixed in a blender. I wouldn't trust any discussion on that board, nor would I ever take one seriously. I feel like half of the posts are just trolls, to be honest. I'd be quicker to buy into the shit on /x/ than on /pol/.

TL;DR: These boards aren't all bad, but are usually packed full of rebels without a cause (except trolling), and have no real impact on the issue of woman's/men's rights. I browse them to be entertained, not to be informed.

andytheg,AskReddit,1389831282.0,"Mostly my friends and I would just play whiffle ball but during senior year of high school (in 2004) I decided it would be a good idea to catalog all of my mix CD's. I assigned each one a number on the disc and wrote out a full track listing on a note card which would sit in the sleeve with the disc in the giant book. For you younguns out there, it looked like [this](http://www.cd-sleeve.com/cdwallet/case-img/72-case-open-sm.jpg). I was very satisfied upon completion but I had no idea how this time-wasting task would help me in the future.

As soon as I got to college that August I found out about iTunes. It was very easy to import any purchased album as it would auto-populate the song, artist, etc. As many of you may know, mix CD's do not do this but my senior-itis paid off big time and I was able to easily input all the information just by using the note card I had made just a few months earlier."

pizzaandburritos,AskReddit,1389831372.0,"I've tried focusing on one area at a time and I find that it is not as effective as hopping around my apartment picking up something here and something there. The biggest obstacle to cleaning for me is that I get too caught up in details. Next thing I know I will have spent an hour trying to organize my pen collection. So I try to just keep moving so as not to lose momentum.  

There are two categories of things: 
1.Things you know what to do with/where they belong
2. Things that you don't know where to put/how to organize

Focus on everything in category 1 first and then leave the organizational projects for later. 

The other big obstacle is that I detest doing laundry. It means I have giant piles of clothes everywhere that I am ""intending"" to launder. I still have not conquered this. One thing I have learned, though, is that I should put clothes away even if I intend to wear them again soon. (Especially in the winter, I sometimes wear stuff a couple of times before washing.) If you are afraid you'll lose track of what's been worn once, designate a drawer for such clothes. Or hang stuff up inside out to indicate that it's been worn. 

Another trick is to have small ""junk box"" in every room. When I'm cleaning, the stuff I don't know what to do with exactly goes in the junk box. The rest of each room is super organized, but the secret is I have a box of crap somewhere hidden. You just have to be conservative about what you put in the junk box. If you can think of a better place to put it, don't be lazy and just shove it in the box because you're in a hurry. "

I'll admit I was oversimplifying, however your statement is subjective to say the least. I can accept that some people find the music to their taste, and that's fine. My objection stems from the flocks of sheep that follow the ""popular"" trend without any idea what it really is. A huge percentage of ""popular"" music these days is autotuned rubbish, and the minute said ""artist"" plays a live concert, they either suck royally, or they lipsync. Too many people simply want to fit in, and are sucked in by all the marketing hype, rather than deciding what is good or bad on its own merit. 

In essence, can you honestly, and with an absolutely straight face, tell me that every single person who proclaims to be a fan of Khaled is not doing it just to seem ""cool"" to someone? I'm pretty sure you can't, and nor would you place significant money on the fact. 

Don't feel bad about it though, it's the nature of marketing to exploit the inherent herd nature of humanity. They're damn good at it, and they've had lots of practice. "

I don't like their wording on this because the paragraph below it doesn't talk about *breeding* but about *breeds* and I do agree that it's not about breeds per say. But *breeding* itself is actually very important as a lot of the temperament is inherited. 

I do dog showing so I know a lot of breeders and read a great amount about it, breeding dogs based on temperament makes a huge difference to the temperament of their offspring. For example one of the most ancient breeds in the world, the Yakutian Laika, was bred to be very good natured towards humans because any dog that showed human aggression was simply killed (now they just neuter/spay them so that they don't reproduce) so as a result the vast majority of Yakutian Laikas are very human friendly. For a more modern example Akitas used to have a very serious issue with aggression in the American lines and a lot has been done to breed it out of them, as a result the Akita today is a lot better tempered.

And shit, the best advice I can give is to just embrace the fact that you'll be freehunting for hours and hours. Don't even bother looking at the forecast, just make yourself a set with Capture Master and Autotracker (or use Fluffy Mask) and a nice and beefy G Rank weapon. Always capture if it's a monster whose commodity you haven't gotten yet, because the rates are like 10-15% higher to get the commodity in your hunt report for captures depending on the monster. I did most of it in a white Bnahabra Suit with Plegia Fantasia for maximum #swag.

Use the time to practice your trick shots! The monsters will barely damage you anyway, so just try to pull off ridiculous things. After freehunting so many damned Rathians I've become pretty good at uppercutting her head when she does the poisonflip, and have scored a KO or two doing so. It's all about keeping it fun, and really it won't take too long in the end.

No. Ultimately at the end of the day, none of your arguments up there have any meaning. If Noah's Ark didn't happen, the Bible is wrong. The Bible is not wrong, ergo, Noah's Ark happened. All of the evidence against it is Liberal propaganda, and if you know where to look, you can find evidence of the truth, like the expeditions to Mt. Ararat. 

Your arguments about genetics can be explained by the purity of the animals' DNA so close to creation, or simply by Miracle. It is harder to believe that the Bible is wrong than to believe that it is. Very smart people have answered all of those questions, so there's no need to question.

ballepung,AskMen,1389831719.0,"Well, women *can* get sex anytime they want. But so can most guys...

The difference is that a woman can easily get sex with a guy roughly around her own ""level"". A guy on the other hand, will have to go for a girl below his level. If not, he has to wait.

Not meaning to sound sexist, but women are deluded when it comes to ""rating"" guys. I remember a survey that showed that if women were to judge guys on a scale from 1 to 10, then the average guy would be a 3 out of 10. Not a 5, which it *should* be. According to the women in the survey, only around 20% of guys are average-looking or above. That is just shocking, and it goes to show that modern women have no clue about where they themselves actually stand in the pecking order. Whenever I hear women complain about guys being bastards, I immediately think that it's because they only go for guys way above their level. Of course they are gonna be left heart-broken!

I cannot count the times ugly/average-looking girls have approached my super handsome best friend, thinking that they have a genuine shot, while completely ignoring other more than good enough guys along the way. I realize that I sound shallow now, but come on! Why would these girls be so confident in getting someone like that, when they offer nothing in return? I'm not just talking about looks either. Some of these girls are not funny, charming, clever, or anything. Yet they expect to get a handsome, clever, funny guy."

viceywicey,AskMen,1389831721.0,"Minced pork with rice w/ steamed bok choy rice.

**Recipe:**

Minced Pork:
1 lb thinly sliced pork belly (Sukiyaki style makes it easier to cook and requires less time)

Ponsu sauce (I eyeball it.  2 tablespoons-ish maybe?)

1 teaspoon Dark Soy sauce

1/2 table spoon brown sugar or drizzle some honey

1/2 Cup minced mushrooms

1/2 Cup minced shallots

1/2 tablespoon Worchester sauce

1 egg


1. Mince the pork
2. Mix the minced pork into large mixing bowl with the worchester sauce and the egg.
3. Caramelize the mushrooms and onions with a dash of honey
4. Mix in the pork and cook till the pork is browned but not fully cooked.
5. Mix in the soy sauce, ponsu sauce, honey/brown sugar.
6. Bring to a simmer and reduce.

For the Rice:

However much rice you want

However much napa and bok choy you want

Chicken stock (homemade if you have the time)

1. Wash rice.
2. Mince the napa and bok choy
3. Put washed rice and minced napa and bok choy into the pot
4. Pour in chicken stock.
5. Add water if you want it softer.
6. Once cooked, turn the heat up to max for about 2 minutes to crisp the bottom and caramelize the veggies.

Eat leftovers within 3 days if possible.  The rice will keep longer, but the pork won't."

When I was dumped by the love of my life, I spent a long time moping around, but eventually found love with another partner. It took my mind off of my heartbreak, for a while. But when that second relationship ultimately ended, my thoughts immediately sprang back to the one. I guess the lesson that I learned is that I needed to take my feelings on head-on, rather than distracting myself and waiting for them to pass.

The colloquial use of the term ""clip"" for removable magazines is thus common and given the context, not even remotely confusing to anyone who reads it.

I think most MRAs know that stereotype isn't true. Yet they seem to ignore feminism isn't responsible for men's issues. Anti-male stereotypes come from the idea that men should act in a strong, sexual aggressive way. Patriarchy is what's hurting men and not feminism.

I asked her to elaborate and she said that she hated the noise from the shower and didn't like the loud noises fireworks make BUT she's always loved loud music. Also apparently wanting a routine is a sign of autism as well. But don't worry, her entire family on her dad's side has autism too though. Even though this was never diagnosed, she just 'knows.'

clairebones,LadiesofScience,1389831907.0,"I did at first feel like I had to work harder than the guys when I was a demonstrator (what my uni called a TA), because I did CompSci so a lot of the young male students like to assume they knew more than me.

I found the best tactic was to be friendly and straight with them. I got to know the students and was friendly and funny with them, but they also knew I wouldn't take any crap and wouldn't accept bad behaviour or stupid excuses for lateness/missing assignments/etc. They seemed to appreciate that the most, because undergrads don't want to be treated like kids but they will walk all over you if you aren't clear that you mean to stick to the rules.

We don't really do the same feedback forms as you do though. But when I had a job interview 6 months ago, a former student who was then on his placement recognised me, and his recommendation basically got me the job because he thought I was that good when I was TAing his class. So I must have done something right :P"

RowdyRabbi,ukulele,1389832042.0,"I'm no expert but I can help with your second and third questions. As far as chords and scales go you'll have no trouble at all transferring over to the uke. It is tuned a major fourth above the four high strings of a guitar. This means that the chord that looks like a 'D major' on your guitar will sound like a 'G major' and the chord that looks like the four high strings of a 'G major' will sound like a 'C major'. This concept didn't hit me until a couple months into picking up the ukulele but once it did it was smooth sailing from there.

I'd recommend avoid using a pick. Also, explore a variety of ways to play chords on the uke. It is a smaller fretboard than the guitar so you'll be able to reach some new finger positions that are impossible on the guitar. Learn these positions and start finding ways to play chords along with melodies at the same time. Without this skill in particular you'll get bored with your ukulele because it will become just a smaller guitar to you.

Have fun!

TL;DR Chords will be easy. Don't use a pick. Learn as many chord fingerings and barres as you can."

You don't need installers or supervisors, the farmers can install them themselves. Transportation shouldn't factor into price because he can drop ship them to the farmers and pass the freight on to them. He doesn't need to expand any capital since he very likely outsources manufacturing, which again as volume increases the manufacturing costs will go down. So really all he needs is advertising, and he gets that every time anyone shares this video, it's the best advertising he could ever imagine because it shows him as honest, highlights the quality of his product, and was free.

mysled,puppy101,1389832280.0,"She's trying to play, it's not aggression. Dogs play with their mouths and tug is oh so fun! 

There are a few steps you can take: 

* Redirect. Always bring a tug toy on walks and play tug with her to let her get out some of her puppy energy

* Teach ""leave it"" or ""drop it"", so you have a cue to stop playing 

* When she grabs the leash, manage by holding her by the collar (so she can't tug) until she drops the leash, then reward reward reward! 

* Try to find a correct behavior that lets her get out some energy you can ask for instead. Teach ""kisses"" or do some trick routines to get out the extra energy. 

With the walking by you, as long as you make sure you don't ever give her a treat when she jumps up, she should figure it out, it just takes time. It's actually probably a good idea to work through it since jumping is something you'll want to make sure she knows will not be reinforced anyway.

Making sure she has plenty of exercise will also help. 

Don't worry about it too much, it's really not aggression, just a puppy being silly :) Mine does this too all the time, and we usually play back because we rarely walk her on leash and the energy/excitement of playing tug is a good reward and gets her amped for stuff like agility class.

mkvgtired,europe,1389832353.0,"&gt; What would you like the centralized authority's powers to consist of? What framework would need to be established for it to have any effect at all?

I think any new regulator has to have actual teeth. I think it would be best if it had pretty broad authority to write rules (similar to the SEC). I am not sure how that complies with EU laws. All nations would have to agree their rules would apply to their country, so again, I cant see the UK agreeing to that. 

The SEC has suggested the new EU regulator embrace regulations substantially similar to their own. That way any company that registers in the US could dual register in the EU and vise versa. 

If you want to see what a third party thinks, Japan is aggressively trying to end the years of stagnation they've had. They looked at SEC and European regulations for securities registrations. Since the SEC essentially requires more disclosure than Japanese regulators they allow any US registration to be dual-registered in Tokyo with minimal paperwork and expense. They looked into having a similar waiver system with Europe, but decided European regulations were not strict enough. 

A new strong regulator could make these cross-border registrations a reality, but only if the new European regulator has teeth. The SEC is adamant about not even considering it with how things are now, and it appears Japanese regulators are on the same page. 

Although I am not London is too concerned about multi-jurisdictional registrations. London is default destination for a lot of companies from developing markets that want to register in a developed market. These companies would likely not meet the requirements the SEC has in place. It is actually in London's best interest if the playing field is not leveled out so I am sure they will fight any deals with US regulators to standardize registration requirements. "

No weed to empty out.  Nothing.  You just hit the Vape Pen like you would any other e-cig.  Just inhale and exhale odorless vapor.  It's really that simple.  They sell several varieties of the oil so you can pick what strain you want.

edit: it costs $50 per oil cartridge.  the pen is free when you buy 2.  my experience is that one cartridge is equivalent to 1/4oz of bud....maybe even a little more.

edit 2:  Here's a link to a [pic of what I got when I bought my Vape Pen](http://imgur.com/zMtXE8G).  You can see the packaging, one spare cartridge, and the pen on the right.  Sorry about how dark it is.  You can see where the metal part on the pen is though.  That's where the cartridge screws in.  When the battery is running low, you just unscrew the cartridge and screw in the USB charger.  It's completely odorless and you can smoke it literally anywhere.  Be careful though.  I sat around with a beer last night and was totally smoking it like it was just an e-cig  at the Barcade.  I must have hit it like 25 times in a row before I realized what I was doing.

To add to that as someone that suffers from a chronic condition (not on disability, but my husband is the main breadwinner):

The problem with working is reliability and consistency. Chronic conditions can flare up, and then fade in severity for a time, then flare up again for days/weeks/months. It is really difficult to hold a job when you are sick for durations like this.  Not because you don't want to work, but because who the hell wants to hire you?

It's really, really difficult to do things when your organs aren't functioning properly. It's not just a matter of ""not being lazy.""  Pushing yourself can result in PERMANENT DAMAGE to vital organs. That doesn't mean you don't try to learn, but with consequences like ""permanent damage they will have to cut out of you and sooner or later it'll be something you can't live without"" you err on the side of caution while you figure it out. 

I suffer from autoimmune conditions.  Once I got the flu. (Actual influenza, not just a virus that people call 'flu.' ) It was *completely indistinguishable* from one of my flare ups. It felt no different.  Trying to do anything when your body is freaking out like that is close to impossible.  

I am self employed and do contribute to our household income. But if I were single and didn't have the financial support of another, I would be terrified that the periods of flare in my condition would be long enough that I would have no chance of saving enough in my periods of good health to coast though.

Another **major** contributor to this is medical coverage. 

If you are self employed, (like I am, and thus avoiding the bad employee issue) and have preexisting conditions, health insurance is really, really expensive.  I haven't checked with the new government stuff. But when I looked in to independent coverage last year this time, my monthly premiums would have been 1,000 a month. Plus copays. Plus co insurance. Plus prescription costs.  I don't make enough to afford that. And when you have chronic health issues, believe me, the bills are **large**, even after insurance.

The couple people I know on disability are on it for insurance/medicare. 

When you can only work sporadically it is extremely difficult to make enough to support yourself and cover these bills.

*And FYI, I don't know if this is true for everyone, but if I were to go on disability, I would get 1200/month. Which is livable. Ish. Just for perspective.*

**TL;DR:  It's more complex than being lazy or not being lazy. Chronic conditions have periods of flare and 'remission' that can make for a very unreliable employee. Without an employer supplying health insurance, health costs are completely out of reach. Disability provides medical coverage as well as a small living stipend.**"

I find it weird that picking something strong snowbally is the best way to make it out of trench, but also something that guarantees you will only advance so far if you do so.  

Particularly given the fact that when people ask for advice this is one of the first points brought up - don't just pick what you want to play but pick what the team needs.  Except this advice just doesn't hold true, depending on what your teammates ratings are.  

edit: Just to clarify, I'm not saying what he's doing is invalid or a demonstration of skill.  I also don't think ""elo hell"" in that it's impossible to advance exists, just that the role you play has a huge impact on your ability to have an impact on the game, and as such a form of ""elo hell"" does exist, but rather that it's more difficult to pull yourself up if you tend to play support or simply pick what your team ""needs"" to avoid conflict.

Buckwheat mead can taste like a barn, and not in a good way.

Clover tends to make a mild mead, since clover nectar is sweet but lacks a strong taste.

Orange blossom mead does, indeed, taste faintly of citrus.

The part of a plant that produces a flower's nectar is also responsible for the taste of the fruit, so it makes a lot of sense that mead made from honey from nectar of a certain plant would taste similar to that plant's fruit.

Edit: If you have easy and cheap access to tupelo honey, use the *hell* out of it for mead.

Yes, I have. Many times. Starting at the age of 4. One of those people gave me an STI and claimed to have gotten pregnant by me as a result of her raping me in my sleep.

&gt; Ever been told that if you try and tell anyone or scream that they'll deny it, call you a slut, blame you for it? After all, it was what you were wearing. It was what you were doing. You're something that doesn't matter. A thing.

No, just told that since I'm a man, I must have wanted it.

&gt; It's something you never get over.

Preaching to the choir, sister.

No, they don't, or they wouldn't trivialize rape by false equivocation."

Esotericgirl,relationships,1389833013.0,"Just another perspective: 

Spending money like this can also be a way to help alleviate depression and anxiety issues (especially if the person already has an unhealthy relationship with food). It sounds as if this *could* be part of the problem with him, if he's feeling inadequate as a contributing provider in the relationship - or for any other reasons.

It's similar to the stereotypical ""women go shopping to feel better"" concept, except with fast food.

It also can help someone feel as if they are in control of something in their life, when they might be feeling very lost and *not* in control.

It sounds to me as if the $25 spending limit you each allotted yourselves each month may not be enough for him. I know that seems like an obvious statement. At the time the initial agreement was made, he may have either felt it really was ok or felt like it wasn't enough but didn't want to upset you by telling you that. 

There is a deep seated feeling of helplessness that can come when one doesn't have any money in their pocket to be able to buy simple things for themselves. I know this from experience. It can be disheartening and make the person feel controlled and even a bit panicked at times (especially if the other person is more of a ""breadwinner"" in the relationship). If he is really feeling stressed only having the $25, ask him what amount would make him feel more comfortable. Be realistic (if he says he wants to spend $3k per month on himself that's not realistic), but also make sure he's honest with himself and you about the number he comes up with.

Work with it from there.

These are a couple of things that you may want to talk with him about and see if they ring true for him.

Also the concept of using cash per month *only* instead of cards for spending is definitely valid.

It sucks that he's done this, and I hope that you're able to recover from it. :/

I wish you luck!"

It's a little different from the main stuff, mostly in that it can have a very strong effect immediately and then wears off quite quickly.  I can see it possibly filling a niche for people who don't have a whole night for a session and/or have work in the morning.  One cigarettes worth won't last the length of a movie, as a point of reference.

^(*)Well, no issues beyond what could be expected from psychoactive substances.  I tend to underestimate it, and last time I used it I destroyed a joint very quickly and that resulted in a very intense, but short lived, experience.  I was way higher than I would ever normally get when using cannabis - and that includes buckies or lungs.

This *is* dangerous for people who aren't used to psychedelics and don't have any practice in evaluating their limits (or suck at that like I do).  My personal opinion is that this is the main cause of the scare-stories that people come out with - jumping in the deep end with potentially a very strong substance.

I don't really make a point of recommending psychoactives, it's something you need to work out for yourself.  But if you really want to try synthetic cannabis, I suggest taking it slow and getting your feet wet first."

screenmagnet,sex,1389833093.0,"Ah, I see. He's scared he'll catch the gay from your strap-on.

Does he know that tons of straight guys are into prostate play and pegging? My guy loves my strap-on in his ass, but is still completely turned off by the thought or sight of a real penis. When he sees me wearing my strap-on, he's not pretending I have a dick. He sees his girlfriend wearing a sex toy that is designed to pleasure his prostate. When I'm fucking him with it, he's not pretending it's a real dick in his ass. He's just thinking 'oh fuck that feels really good.' The reason he likes pegging is very simple -- he likes it because it makes him cum buckets. It's all about the physical sensations he gets from it. That's all there is to it for him. He's not bi. He's not into transsexuals. He's not turned on by dicks. He's not even turned on by being emasculated or humiliated. Quite the opposite -- most of the time, he prefers to aggressively dominate me in bed. And he's pretty much your quintessential preppy dudebro in most respects - he's into sports, working out, cars, video games, playing guitar, and the stock market. There's nothing the least bit alternative about him, except for the fact that he likes his girlfriend to peg him in the ass a couple times a month. Otherwise, he's as mainstream as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread.

Since your bf is not completely secure in his sexuality, I think your best bet is to downplay any gender-bending/role-reversal/power exchange aspects of pegging. Instead, present it to him as being just another way to bring him prostate stimulation, but combined with a feeling of fullness and the unique sensation of getting fucked. Tell him you want to peg him because you have heard that it can make a man cum really hard, and the idea of bringing him so much pleasure turns you on. Buy a non-realistic looking dildo (not flesh coloured, no balls, abstract shape) and a girly looking harness. I recommend a double ended toy like the feeldoe or share, and a cute underwear harness from velvet nest, combined with some sexy, feminine lingerie. But before you even get to that stage, you need to move from fingers to butt plugs and other small prostate toys. I highly recommend starting with a small plug (angled for prostate stimulation) in his ass while he fucks you. Then graduate to a larger vibrating toy (e.g. the aneros vice), again during PIV, anal (on you), or while he face fucks you. You can also finger his ass and massage his prostate while he fucks you doggy style (just reach between your legs with one hand). 

The goal is to normalize the idea of something in his ass for him, and get him to associate it with orgasm and sex in general. And having a plug, aneros, or fingers in his ass while he is dominating you (face fucking you, or ploughing into you hard and fast from behind) should help break the association in his mind between pegging and submissiveness/emasculation. He needs to see that getting pegged doesn't make him less of a man, or make you less of a woman, and that it won't change the way you see him or treat him inside or outside the bedroom.

Hope that helps. Anyone who is reading this -- feel free to PM me if you have questions. : )"

Doctors, Nurses, EMTs, Police and Firemen do more heroic actions every day than the majority of the military. I'm tired of the American jingoism and hero worship of our military. They know what they're signing up for, and they're getting excellent benefits and pay for what they do, so don't ask me to do anything more than say ""good job for doing your job."""

vk93,lotr,1389833231.0,My mother bought me the lord of the rings &amp; hobbit books before the film was out (1999) so I think if it was well known enough for my mother to know about it then it was still very popular before the films came out.
small_havoc,explainlikeimfive,1389833232.0,"Yeah I mean, maybe the connotation sounds different in English, but I would be embarrassed to say I was a victim of ""Eve Teasing"". I would also feel embarrassed to say I was sexually assaulted (in certain company like my parents), but I would feel fundamentally ashamed to say ""Eve Teased"". Both the words ""Eve"" and ""Tease"" make me uncomfortable, as it puts focus on *my* sexuality (Eve) and the word ""tease"" negates any severity possible. If ""teasing"" is the threat of ""something else"" - sex - the sexual assault is verbally considered the ""teasing"" of sex. In this case, if someone is complaining of an instance of Eve Teasing, we would assume they would not have liked to engage in sex either, meaning rape, as unwanted sex is rape. So it also seems to downplay the importance of the idea of rape at the same time. 

So ""I was sexually assaulted"" turns into ""I was sexually appealing and resisted his playful advances"" - which doesn't really sound like something you would prosecute someone with. I wouldn't even be able to take myself seriously if those were the terms I had at my disposal to verbalize an attack made upon me - and so I would be immediately discouraged from speaking about it. My own discouragement would make me downplay the event itself and... there it goes. It really just encourages shutting up. Which just encourages the behaviour, because it's not addressed, because victims shut up. And so it remains acceptable, because the assholes are nodding and smiling, and the victims are unable to get respect from any avenue - not even their own language.

I don't know if I'm correct in any of this by the way, this is just how I see it as someone who invests too much time thinking about language and its effects on culture (and its birthing through culture). I could be WAY off. There's also probably another way to rephrase eve-teasing, though I imagine some women would be even less likely to speak without a euphemism."
sunshinerf,AskWomen,1389833234.0,"No problem, I am happy to answer.

He only decided we have no future when I gave him an ultimatum. Why did I stay? Because he said we do have a future, many times. And I loved him so much I wanted to believe him. And I was blind. The last few months of our relationship I was always on the brink of ending it, I couldn't trust him anymore. I wasn't happy but kept telling myself it's just a phase.

I have no idea why he did it over the phone. The last thing I told him is that I never thought he would be such a disrespectful coward. He never dared to face me because he knew it would be too hard to see me cry.

He actually texted me a week after new years, which was odd. I don't know why, he was horny? I don't care to be honest. I'm happy he did because it made me realize I am over him. Because it felt victorious. When I went to get my things and see my babies one last time I gave his brother a letter to give him. I wrote that when he wakes up in a few months realizing he made the worst mistake of his life not to call me to tell me he misses me cause it's too late. And then he did! 

With all that being said, I would have never changed a thing. I was happy with him for the most part of our relationship and we were a good team. No regrets about this relationship what-so-ever. It will never deter me from seeking another one. Long term relationships are great!"

They have a ton of nursing schools in the area, and they have mayyybe 10 large hospitals in the area, only one of which being a lvl 1 trauma center (UCSD)....these are just two examples that I have personally dealt with, so I won't speak for the other metros so confidently, I'll just say that asserting moving should be the last resort is actually not true for a lot of people...

You couldn't be more wrong if you tried. I listen to all sorts of weird music, some of it even falls into the ""pop"" genre. I've not once judged someone who is a true fan of any given artist, and about the only reason I can see for your little meltdown there is that you're butthurt because I disrespected an artist that you personally like.

The difference between you and me is that I don't feel the need to jump in boots first to defend my music preferences when someone suggests the artist has an over-inflated popularity due to clever marketing. I like what I like for my own reasons, and I don't give two shits if someone else loves it or hates it. That's called personal preference, and is why love of music is utterly subjective. If you feel the need to point out that ""X music is awesome because millions of people like it"" then you've completely missed the point. Millions of people like the music because they're sheep, and I don't care what the mob thinks. What I'm interested in is why a single individual, in this case you, thinks the music is good.

&gt;Music is about far more than political statements and complex song structures.

This is about the only point in your rant where you say something truly insightful. You're absolutely 100% correct. Some of the most influential music of the last two millennia has been completely politics free, and in many cases is beautiful in its simplicity. Personally I don't like all that much of it, but unlike you, I can appreciate it for what it is, regardless of my personal tastes. 

I'd be happy to discuss with you the elements of Khaled's music that you find so inspiring, but before that's possible, you need to get over the fact that not everyone will agree with you, and that in disagreeing with you, they don't automatically think they're better than you. That's nothing more than a martyr complex, and it's not very becoming."

Let's do it.

*gulp*"
Omega037,changemyview,1389833768.0,"&gt; 1) look at the history of representative democracies. the hired criminals of wannebe despots are typically the threat, not state forces. state forces often sit it out and let the civilian factions sort things out.

Seriously, I think you have a very incorrect view of history, or just are just making this up whole cloth.

Don't just say ""look at the history"" and then pull whatever conclusion you want out of your hat.  Give me a specific example or two.

&gt; 2) assault rifles kill almost no one compared to pools. most pool deaths are kids taken there by parents.

Yes, but I assumed from the beginning that your view extended to all guns have been arguing against firearms in general this entire time.  This includes handguns and shotguns. 

So unless you are against banning assault rifles but are for banning handguns, it is a moot point.

Also, I mentioned how pools only kill those who choose to use them, while guns kill those who don't choose to engage in gun ownership.  You still haven't addressed that difference.

&gt; 3) lethal guns have been around for almost a millenia and have typically been restricted to elites. Elites in history almost always were much better armed than the populace. 

First, ""millenia"" is plural, ""millenium"" is singular.

Second, the one shot, low accuracy hand cannons don't really count, and you know it.  A bow or melee weapon would likely have been a more effective weapon.  Only with the more advanced muskets of the 17th century do we see anything really comparable to modern day weapons that are effective for defense.

As for only the elites owning guns, what is your point?  Guns were expensive so the poor couldn't generally afford them.  The same is true of books, but that doesn't mean that the elite actively kept people illiterate.

Regardless, I am advocating that both poor *and* elites in the country give up their weapons, so again it is a moot point.

&gt; Examples are endless, but let's use the one people are most familiar with - Weimar Germany. 

This is the worst possible example you could give.  Guns were heavily restricted in Germany in 1920.  However, those restrictions were *relaxed* in 1928 and later in 1938.

**In other words, getting rid of strong gun control corresponded with the rise of Nazi Germany.**

&gt; Besides the US, you will have trouble finding large developed countries who are armed roughly as well as criminals and the police.

So you are admitting that there is little historical evidence to back your claims, after repeatedly telling me that I just needed to ""look at the history""?

&gt; And its a coincidence that their have been not despots in the US since 1789, but despots have been rampant almost everywhere else until Pax Americana.

There is no shortage of despots today, many of them due to (or at least supported by) us.  I also find it funny that you seem to think that the lack of global war in the past 6 decades is somehow due to civilians having guns and not a decimated Europe after WWII and a nuclear stalemate between the major powers.

&gt; Pax American is not something I am defending and the wars mentioned were an attempt to extend western civilization's front linmes against ""Communism.""

Some of them were, but some of them (Iran-Iraq War, Nigerian Civil War, and Sudanese Civil War) weren't.

&gt; Almost anyone but Lincoln would have let the South go. 

Do you seriously believe this?  Was this something you were honestly taught?  

While certainly there were *some* Northerners who were alright with succession, most were not.  Furthermore, there were also Southerners who were against it as well.

&gt; Today, people wouldn't have the fortitude to go shoot their cousins and brothers. Personal manhood and honor are much diluted since that time making armed citizens more of a deterrence than ever.

Once again, you seem to agree with my point that preventing civilians from having guns wouldn't really change anything from a ""protect us from government despots"" point of view.

&gt; Remember, the main threat history shows in rep demos are demagogues and their criminal thugs, not state military organs.

Again, you state things like this but they just aren't true.  The main threats to representative democracies have been external conflicts, economic collapse, or internal corruption.

There is also a reason they call violent overthrows of peaceful governments a ""military coup"", because they are generally done either by the military, with the help of the military, or with a revolutionary army.  They then physically overpower the current government and take control.

Anyways, I think I am going to stop arguing here.  There is no chance that I am going to change your view because you seem to prefer to just make up facts that support your view rather than take the time to actually look into them and make a decision.

alwaysnightandday,dataisbeautiful,1389833781.0,"&gt; The idea that you can expand horizontally (i.e., occupy greater area) while reducing transportation (distance + cost) across that area is entirely false. How can an increased area require less distance (also time and money) to traverse it? That's just not how geography works.

I think by ""horizontal expansion"", NeuroG means something more like building townhouses between existing town houses. This way, you're not increasing the area of the region needed to be traversed (and thus not the distances), only having more of that area be covered by housees.

I mean: Suppose you have two regions with *the same population density*:

A: Tall high rises, with each person occupying a large amount of floor space    
B: Townhouses, with each person occupying a small amount of floor space.

It seems clear to me that the average distances to amenities should be approximately the same in A and B, and thus that population density alone does account for differences in transportation costs.

More concretely: Suppose that A and B both have 20000 people per square mile. Suppose also that one standard-issue hair salon covers the need for 20000 people. Then, in both A and B, there would be on average one standard-issue hair salon in each square mile. It follows that, in both A and B, the average resident would need to travel something like half a mile to find a hair salon. This is only a function of the population density, and not of how tall the buildings are."

First: If ""consciousness is essentially a phenomenon of information"" then how do you define information? So far as anyone has ever been able to prove information is a pattern represented in matter, not a state of matter. Considering that patterns in matter can come about arbitrarily this seems a very weak point to base consciousness on.

Second: If ""this information must be integrated in a unified whole so that it is impossible to divide into independent parts"" then human beings fail the consciousness test. Split brain patients, dissociative identity disorder, and all manner of normal distributed processes in our brain act as counter examples.

Third: Invoking Quantum Mechanics to explain basically anything is an absolute scientific fail. 

""But what’s fascinating about his approach is that it is formulated using the language of quantum mechanics in a way that allows detailed scientific reasoning.""

No. It really doesn't. It borrows language from one of the most poorly understood branches of physics (even among physicists) to try to give credence to some metaphysical point. Inventing words like ""perceptronium"" to mean ""the most general substance that feels subjectively self-aware"" illustrates a phenomenal misunderstanding of subjective perception. Any neuroscientist with any understanding of the brain will laugh at the idea of self awareness being due to some mystical substance that human beings apparently have."

you do realise that its actually more valid to judge someone for their belief than their nationality or race right? you can change or choose your religion you cant choose or change your race or nationality (well not really/properly) and its no different from an ideology.

Read the following:

""The reason I have negative opinions of Niggers is because I've lived with them, grown up around them, and I've seen and been affected by the way they act. And the trend has been very consistent from person to person.""

Do you find that offensive? ignoring the racial slur which is deliberate to show just how offensive your process of judgement and thinking is.

In its simplest form you are racist with a racist mentality because you openly declare that middle eastern men are ""all of a particular type"" (from person to person).


I genuinely have 0 sympathy for you feeling left out of ""judged"" as you clearly have been and find it acceptable to judge others, for things they have no impact or influence in (their nationality/race), yet seem to take issue on people judging you 
on your view and understanding of the world (such as religion or your racist ideology)

So. All things considered, if it still works, even a little, you should do fine. Just brush up on the other parts of sex. If you are having problems with a sex drive, due to said injury, consult your doctor about it. Maybe go see a sex councilor.

From there, he introduced a passenger service to North America with the Great Western liner, the largest ship of its time, and the only one capable of making the journey under steam (I do not count the Sirius, which ended up burning a mast to complete the trip). The railway and the liner were part of the same concept - to connect the North American continent to London.

In so doing, he also invented large-scale project management. The line was build with entirely manual labour, with about 5000 men employed for the purpose - a far larger endeavour than the building of the pyramids, and accomplished in a lesser time."

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1389834319.0,"No, because what you do while you're drunk is your responsibility. The other person in a car crash is not entering a contract with you to damage your vehicles; rather, in this instance the other guy is a victim because they did not wish or consent to getting involved in an accident, and lacked the agency necessary to control the situation. Your analogy is a poor one.

It takes two people minimum to have sex. If there is an imbalance of agency, no sex should be happening; that is to say, if agency in one individual is compromised in any way (i.e. they're drunk) while the other person's agency is not (i.e. sobriety) then neither should be having sex with each other. It doesn't matter that the blacked out person got drunk of their own volition--what matters is that they lack the agency to make a decision on their own at that moment, and thus cannot possibly give valid consent. The other person assuming consent is thereby a rapist, as they bypass the necessary prerequisites for consent (sobriety and knowledge of the forthcoming events)."

screenmagnet,sex,1389834332.0,"Ok. This has just not been my experience. My bf has been prescribed cialis right off the bat by two different doctors (and they knew it was an anxiety issue, because he has had a battery of tests in the past to rule out physical causes, and he has never had issues with morning wood or erections while masturbating). One was a family doc and the other was a doc in a walk in clinic he had never seen before.

And all the urologists I have worked with routinely tried Cialis or Viagra right off the bat with young guys who came in with ED, even when it looked like it was performance anxiety (which it usually is in young guys). In fact, they treated it as first line therapy, and would typically only investigate further or refer for psychotherapy if the drugs DIDN'T work. Their thinking was that since ED meds are such a quick and easy fix, and psychotherapy is so time consuming and expensive (and may not work anyway), that it always makes sense to try the meds first. Because if it works, the problem is solved right off the bat. And most guys who have performance anxiety related ED only need to take the meds the first few times. After that, they typically get over their anxiety and don't need the meds anymore. That's how it was for my bf - he only needed it the first 2-3 times, and then never had trouble getting it up again after that. But he still asks his doc for a prescription anyway, because we both like to use it recreationally (for marathon weekend sex, for extra teasing while he purposefully goes without orgasms for several days, or for combining with boner killers such as alcohol or ecstasy).

A follow up note on pain: It *really* messes with your head. You sort of get use to it.  But in a little bit of a bizarre way. People get short tempered, emotional, lash out at others. Again, this doesn't mean it's impossible to find ways of making money, but it adds a complication to interactions with people. Or even if you can handle conversations without breaking down, people get weirded out when they see you rocking back and forth. Or smacking various parts of your body because that sharp, acute pain gives relief from the chronic pain that's plaguing you.

Strong people do learn to 'play the shit hand they were dealt.' But not everyone is strong. And not all strong people are strong in the ways they need to be to overcome chronic pain.

Pain is hard to think through. Not hard to cope with. But hard to cope and also perform any other task with.  When you stub your toe, or smash your finger with a hammer, etc, are you able to sit down and calmly sell a product to someone over the phone? Or do data entry? Or do you hop around and curse and shake the injured digit?

Again, people do learn to cope. But that takes time.  And often, the coping mechanisms have to be done in private, being either distasteful to watch, or just plain upsetting to everyone else that would like to pretend you aren't in constant pain.

tbhoggy,Portland,1389834562.0,"Just in case you want a reassuring story:

I moved here in November (21 year old male) after dropping out of college and spending 6 months in AmeriCorps. I didn't have a ton of money saved up, I didn't have any business connections, and didn't have a job lined up before I got here. I had a friend and a place to crash for cheap while I got my feet on the ground. 

Within a week I had had 7 or 8 interviews and by day 10 in Portland I started training. I ended up with a couple job offers, nothing spectacular, but all livable wages (24-28k/yr) all in different fields (retail, electronics repair, contracting). 

My advice is for when you get here is to sit down and work *at least* a 40 hour week applying for jobs. Your job is to find a job, right? Make it full time. This means be at your computer at 8 and work until 5, no reddit, no bullshit. Trawl craigslist, spending a good chunk of time tailoring your resume to each job application.

It's not impossible to get a job. That being said, if you're moving here with the expectation that you can get a job that will support your 900/month student loans and have a great time, Portland may be the wrong place to move.

I am definitely in a mode of ""rebuilding my life"". I am finding new friends, new hobbies and trying to figure out what type of woman I want to be with.

This may sound strange, but I am actually going slow because I care about her. I don't want to move too fast for the wrong reasons and then hurt her later on by breaking up. 

I want to make sure I am with her because I like HER and not because she is ""not my ex"" or just because she matches a list of requirements that I have dreamed up.

My ex also affected me in ways I didn't full understand until I was with another woman. It is taking me some time to really believe that my new girl is as great as she seems. Sometimes she does things that my ex would not even consider talking about. 

Your guy sounds like he is ready to move on, but he needs to go slow. Be understanding that everything in his life is now open to change and he needs to make some big decisions, including the person he chooses to share his life with."

So, I don't think Ni has to leap into a forecast, but when you're interpreting meaning, it can be hard not to take the next step and hypothesize the likely or potential outcome of what you've interpreted. 'If this, then ___.' 

What's funny about Ni, for me, is that often I don't know I'm processing an 'if this' scenario, and go straight to 'ah ha!' and fill in the blank. But if you ask me to defend my summation, I can fumble backwards and identify the equation that led to my conclusion, rifling through that storehouse of models you speak of. 

Thanks for sharing your story. I can imagine the internal knowledge you riffed through to intuit that you were in a bad way. I had hoped this topic would take off with more examples of Ni, considering that it's our dominant function.

_shnazzy,books,1389835109.0,"The books detail an abusive relationship between an asshole and a dumb twat. 

The differences between ""real life"" and the book start from the very beginning of their intimacy (and the informed consent issue is a huge qualm the BDSM community has with these books, one of many, obviously...). After he's stalked her, shown up uninvited at her job, kidnapped her from a bar (all the while she's herp derpin along), she's back at his place, she confesses she's a virgin with literally zero sexual experience (Grey gave her her first kiss (but then that's later contradicted, so w/e)), and so then he has sex with her and introduces her to the idea of being his sub. This chick has the sexual maturity of a 5 year old. Being in a sub/dom relationship requires you to have an incredible sexual maturity, and to know your partner so well. You have this insane deep level of trust. You have to build on ground rules that both parties can understand and agree on.

If Christian were a bonafide Dom and a stand up guy, he would have understood that Ana has no sexual identity, and that it's incredibly inappropriate to be in a position of sexual power over someone with no identity of their own. How can she know what's right for her or wrong if she's never done anything sexual, and all she has is what her Dom says is right or wrong, which she will think she has to listen to because Rules (and because she's innately just that spineless.) The issue is, Ana has no way of consenting to being Grey's sub because she has no way of knowing what it even means to be in any kind of relationship. She gets a sheet of ground rules for the relationship and the thing she takes issue with is that he will control her diet. She doesn't have the depth of knowledge of sex to even consider that she may not be okay with orgasm denial (spoiler, turns out she's not okay with it, one of the fucking stupidest parts of the books imo), or bondage or caning.

I feel like this isn't as coherent as I need it to be. That's just ONE issue in the very beginning of the FIRST book. IT GOES ON. The books are so full of fuck it's hard to get it all lined out. And I'm not even in to bondage. The lack of research that went into these books was enough to piss me off FOR the BDSM community.

There's also this pervasive idea in the books that the only people with kinks are ones with fucked up childhoods and Mommy/Daddy issues. That there's no way a ""normal"" person would be into ""that stuff"". Christian had this real bad early life, and he was abused later in the name of BDSM. And now he's maintaining an absolute power dynamic in a relationship with a girl with 0 experience. And *that's* the story that's introducing millions of women to the idea of kinky sex. Not that a strong experienced woman falls in love with a strong experienced man and they explore the outer limits of human sexuality together, building on respect and trust, maintaining super open communication.

&gt; Can you demonstrate that the OT rules out that the messiah will die, be resurrected, and come back later?

Yes. The OT which is complete, eternal, and perfect, does not mention it.

&gt;If only scriptures will satisfy you...

These are not very explicit at all. Psalm 22 is based on a terrible mistranslation. Isaiah 53 ignores that thing called context. And Daniel 7 is so vague that you make it say what you want.

&gt;This of course stems entirely from Jewish tradition, not scripture.

If your host is good, the best way to corrupt them is by encouraging them to let you help them to do good. Make it irresistible to not give in, to seize the power to do more good.

Sadly, if your player knows it's a demon trying to corrupt them they'll be able to avoid any attempts to corrupt them. There really isn't any moment when a player is forced to make a character decision of that magnitude. It's simply too difficult to make them care for characters. In a fiction a character can be driven to take on the mantle of demonic corruption to save the life of their child or precious friends, but in a game the emotional ties that would make a person sacrifice themselves for others simply aren't there for the average player.

Dating is tough. I just really think the issues each gender faces is completely different and it is like comparing apples to oranges.

You are absolutely right about the way women rate men strictly on looks. OkCupid has a ton of data on it which is fascinating. However, I think when it comes to attraction, women approach it differently overall by considering a lot more factors than looks. I know men do the same thing, but once again, it's just different and it is hard to compare.

Whether you sound sexist/misogynistic/one-sided, doesn't really bother me. I've gotten used to that here.

Imagine that you *are* the current, traveling in some arbitrarily positive or negative direction, and that you can see the magnetic field that you're inducing.  You can define its as clockwise or counterclockwise, but once that definition is set, you'll always see it curling the same way.  That seems strange, doesn't it?

CPU: great cpu, same one i have and won't bottleneck the GPU at all

GPU: it's a high-end GPU, plays almost all games at 1080p on ultra without a problem ( i also own that same card, just from EVGA)

PSU: OCZ is a good brand, and what he said about the GPU using 500w is BS, not even 2 760's use 500w. the reason GPU's say 500w is recommended is because the manufacturers are already counting all the parts in an usual PC.

RAM: RAM is almost the same from any brand, but A-data is a great brand, it just has been out of the game for a while so it is not as known as corsair or some others.

HDD: seagate is a great HDD brand, and the most recommended in this site, you can't go wrong with them (i also have that HDD)

MOBO: ASrock is a good Motherboard brand, cheap and reliable, of course ASUS/MSI/Gygabyte are better, but for a budget build, this would work fine, though i would go with the ASUS m5a78 that /u/teaearlgraycold recommended.

CASE: cooler master cases are very good for budget builds, and a very reputable brand too.

So all in all, this guy is just trying to make a sale, none of these components are ""low-end"", and building a PC is not hard at all (just follow the instructions, and have patience) i built my first one a week ago, took me 3-4 hours to build it and a couple of hours to get windows up and running."
Khad1013,MorbidReality,1389835385.0,"""On September 21, 2011, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas held a press conference to announce the results of the investigation. Rackauckas announced that according to the Orange County Coroner, the cause of death was ""asphyxia caused by mechanical chest compression with blunt cranial-facial injuries sustained during physical altercation with law enforcement."" Rackauckas said Thomas died because of the force of the officers on his chest, which made it impossible for him to breathe. This caused Thomas to become unconscious. He then slipped into a coma and died when taken off life support five days later.
According to Rackauckas, the coroner stated that the injuries to Thomas' face and head contributed to his death. Also contributing to his death were brain injuries, facial and rib fractures, and the extensive bruising and abrasions he suffered during the beating, which left him lying in a ""growing pool of blood,"" Rackauckas said. The toxicology report shows that Thomas had no illicit drugs or alcohol in his system. Thomas was severely bleeding and struggled and pleaded, ""I can't breathe,"" ""Dad, help me."" The DA stated that the officers did not reduce their level of force during the nearly 10-minute assault, however Thomas combated with officers for almost eight full minutes""

There are other health care markets that use private insurers. Switzerland, the Netherlands, etc. use private insurers and have fairly good quality systems. Many other countries have basic public care and private companies make up the rest. In places like France and Canada most people have supplemental private policies to help pay for what the government program does not.

anonlymouse,rpg,1389835777.0,"&gt; That's also not true. With DR and resistances, you can easily have encounters that can't end (there was one I was in where the monster couldn't beat our AC, but we couldn't beat its DR and resistances).

I've had encounters that couldn't end, but they were in 4e with status effects. In O/A/CD&amp;D where descending AC was used, and DR wasn't a thing, that wasn't the case. d20 brought in a number of stacking problems, so that's really not a flaw of HP as much as it is the system as a whole.

&gt;But that's part of the problem- until you're low on hit points, there isn't any tension. You can quickly get a sense of your enemy's damage output, and know that you have nothing to worry about until you're within a critical hit of death. The opening of the fight is painfully boring.

Only if you're focused on encounter balance. If not, which was again the environment HP were originally used in, you really have no idea if you can be killed in a single hit because the enemy hasn't been encountered before, and HP only increase marginally after 10th level."

screenmagnet,sex,1389835785.0,"Well, you have already found one person who likes your body type (your fwb). So don't you think there are others out there who will like it as well?

Also, some couples may pick you precisely *because* you are heavier. Many girls, because of insecurities about their own weight, are not comfortable having threesomes or swapping with a girl who is skinnier than they are. I remember back when I had a threesome with my first boyfriend, I felt this way. I was thrilled to find a girl who was attractive, but slightly heavier than me. It allowed me to relax and enjoy the experience, without obsessing over my own body as I would have if the girl had been thinner than me. At your weight, you are in the sweet spot for that. You are heavy enough to make insecure girls feel more at ease, but light enough that most people will still find your body attractive. The girl I had the threesome with was pretty much your exact height and weight, and both me and my ex found her attractive (and neither of us are specifically attracted to BBWs or chubby girls).

In terms of making you feel more confident in the photos -- play around with lighting, use a lower resolution setting on your camera (or use a web cam -- everyone looks good on webcam), and wear some sexy lingerie. Don't hide the fat, but feel free to dress it up in some pretty lace. : )

I am trying to wrap my head around this. Because he is literally asking how to invest his liquid funds, and instead of helping with that, everyone is getting caught up on diversification via land sale. That makes zero sense to me. Zero. How do we know the land is worth several hundred thousand dollars? And for that matter, wouldn't a prospective buyer do the research on it to know if it is worth buying or not? If it is going to keep producing, someone will know. In that case, buyers will line up to do so but also in that case, there is no reason to sell it. 

Either it keeps producing money and he should keep it, or you all forsee it sputtering out and not producing. If the latter, it won't be worth much to anyone and he should probably keep it anyway.

And at the end of it all, at least he will still have a stake in some land, regardless of whether it is still producing oil or not."

People have even posted stats about how volatile it all is.

So the way I see it: keep the thing and hope for the best. If it sputters out oh well you have some cash and some land anyway, invest the cash, sit on the land or sell it at that point if you want. But right now I think itd be best to invest his money to diversify and not try to sell.

ballepung,AskMen,1389836104.0,"&gt; I cannot count the times I've seen a smart, interesting and funny woman with an asshole

The keyword being ""with"". Why did they accept this asshole in the first place? For me, it's either one of these two:

1) They have confidence issues or deep psychological problems

or

2) The guy is an asshole because he *can* be an asshole. Hot women still love him, so he's obviously bringing *something* to the table.

Whenever I see good guys with shitty women, it's not so much because they have issues or because the woman is bringing something good to the table. He's simply given up on hunting for women like a mad man, and gone for the simple solution. A lot of guys, unfortunately, seems to think that bad pussy is better than no pussy. These guys are obviously a part of the problem. When these guys choose to ""date down"", they only give other women hope that they can get away with the same thing.

I have met several handsome, smart, funny, and nice guys in their mid-twenties who still are virgins. But I've never met a woman older than 20 who has the same qualities but still is a virgin. And I doubt that this is a coinscidence.

&gt; it more upsets me that it seems so many guys in /r/AskMen think all women are shallow, nasty beasts who are only after a guy for money.

I'm not that active in here, but I really hope that this isn't the case. That would make this a very sad subreddit..

blackinthmiddle,firstworldproblems,1389836112.0,"While I would never pay $2500 for a laptop, there are a number of things I like about the MacBook Pro. Or another way to put it, there are things I hate about Windows. 

* I love Mac OS X. The operating system is the best blend of a stylish, intuitive GUI with Linux under the hood. Different versions don't change so much that it's a brand new operating system. I program for a living and don't have time to learn an entirely new os. Which brings me to Windows. 

* Windows 8. Wtf??? I think Microsoft simply lost their way with their latest os. I've had *many* a friend call me up in pure frustration, upset that they can't figure out how to do basic things. And here's the kicker: the change is not an improvement. Once you figure out, ""oh, this is how you do it"", you realize it was just change for the sake of change and not to improve things. Microsoft had no vision with their latest os and simply reacted to what Apple was doing. And if you put effort into learning it? They'll probably change enough of it so that you'll have to relearn many parts of it next time they decide to change for the sake of change. 

*I have a MacBook Air. I also have an old, black MacBook and the optical drive was screwing up. I took it to the apple store and they fixed it, free of charge. We're taking a 6 year old laptop here! 

* I like the design innovations of the MacBook Pro like the backlit keyboard and the mag safe connector and the fact that the hardware and software are built for each other from the ground up. 

Again, I refuse to spend $2500 for a laptop. But I won't spend $250 for some crap net book either.

Umm no, just no I have never been intimidated by what a woman does for a living. Nor can I think of any male friend who has said they were intimated when dating some woman that had a better job then them . I think you are deluding yourself.

All ( most*) all my male friends who have dated a woman who made more money it has ended badly because the women became , arrogant,  sexist , abusive, and used their income disparity as a cudgel to make nasty remarks or the go to weapon in a fight.  ( * the one guy I can think of that the relationship lasted and left on his terms  was a gold digger who used her till he got his degree in his Twenties then left her ) . 

&gt;aren't men wary of gold diggers

Yeah, but you use your judgement for that. They come from all walks of life.    

&gt;I get the whole macho must be the provider of the family but why would a guy date someone with such a huge income dispairty?

Again no.  I can only speak for myself but I do not judge women on their income / status / education . I date them / marry them because the make me happy . Your friend is most likely happy with a school teacher that he can come home to and have a nice relaxing time with and start a family rather some woman harping about how much he make and mistaking his revulsion for her as ""being intimidating""

Here is a little example...
That would be the equivalent of having a spy go to a large public place where he doesn't know his target unless he can make a positive ID. What you suggest would mean that the spy would have to announce his presence to everyone in the area, including the target he needs to ID. 3 things could happen, 1.) The target may run away, 2.) The target could attack the spy now that the spy's cover is blown or 3.) The target could also do whatever he was going to do in the first place.

 &gt;I feel like if you knew the history of the culture and politics of Islam the way I do, you would understand. You haven't been exposed to their history and culture the way I have. I'm not saying they're bad because they are a certain religion. I'm saying I don't have any positive expectations from the ones who are brought up in a backward destructive society. Because it is likely that their culture has instilled undesirable beliefs in them.

if you were muslim (not sure if you are) and you read that on some note you found in a lecture theatre would you take offence? would you be outraged?

Now i would actually argue religious criticism and judgement actually is more valid than racial or national, since religion is set on a system of core beliefs or principles which obviously will influence your life and culture (for that is specifically what religion claims to do)

&gt; I don't treat them any different than anyone else, so I'm not a total monster. Just a little one &gt;.&lt;

no you just knowingly hold and maintain the ideology of bigotry and it will indeed bleed through into your actual subconcious treatment of others.

But I do think that it's a strong correlation, and that there's probably some causation in there too. If you morally object to someone's behavior, that can and does often alter how you treat them unless you make a pretty conscious decision for it not to.

Yes, it's not a ""must"" thing. But it's a probably or likely thing, which is why homophobia is bad. It's not enough that someone doesn't vote against marriage equality. Homophobia in all its manifestations has the potential for a lot of harm. Granted, we all can identify which manifestations are most harmful -- such as the denial of rights or criminalization of behavior. But that doesn't imply that someone who doesn't do those behaviors is not inclined to treat gay people poorly. They might not even realize how they treat gay people, since their values are so reflexive (I'm a good person, but homosexuality is a sin).

TL;DR - you don't have to be a totally aggressive bigot to be a bigot. Sometimes, being a bigot in small ways is possible even if you think that you're not acting like a bigot. I'm not willing to give someone who confesses that they think of homosexuality as a sin the benefit of the doubt."

Englishrose_,changemyview,1389837073.0,"&gt;Your first citation is rates of self-reporting in a survey, and without a consistent definition of physical assault. Throw in selection bias, and we're talking about a huge number of ways it would tend to underreport male abuse.

I think male domestic violence is probably underreported, but in an anonymous survey, I don't think it's so underreported that there would be such a gross disparity.  If you have any solid statistics that domestic violence is really 'roughly equal', then link a source.  The one link you gave me was a survey (which you said wasn't an accurate form of support)  Also the stat that '1,247 women and 440 men were killed by an intimate partner', doesn't come from a survey, that comes from real criminal records.

I think domestic violence primarily affects women and so it should be a focus of feminism and that obviously domestic violence against men isn't taken as seriously by the public/police, but feminism is advocating for gender equality by specifically focusing on women's rights and so the fact that men are perceived that way isn't central to their cause.  I think changing ideas about the way men are treated/viewed in domestic violence cases is important and I also don't agree with the idea feminism doesn't recognise that this is a problem (or somehow thinks domestic abuse is exclusively a women's issue)  -- it's just not what that school of thought is meant to be focusing on.

And really, if sexism didn't perpetuate the idea that women are weak and powerless, then maybe society would take domestic abuse towards men a bit more seriously.  I hate to say it, but so many of the issues that mens rights activists claim are a problem are really what I see as the patriarchy back-firing on itself.  'Women are weak and therefore can't hurt a man, so if he's complaining of domestic abuse, it must not be serious'.  Feminism proving that women are powerful and the equals of men, might actually make people realize that women are just as capable of domestic violence as men.

&gt;there should be no claims that feminism is about ""equality"" or represents both male and female interests.

Really? Feminism isn't about equality? I wouldn't say means to be a representative for male interest, but feminism is kind of entirely about equality.  Even male rights activists agree that women are at a greater disadvantage than men and so by advocating women rights in areas in which they are disadvantaged (equal pay for example) feminism tries to bridge the inequality (aka they try to make women closer to being the equals of men in society).  THEY MAKE THINGS EQUAL BY GIVING WOMEN THE SAME RIGHTS/PRIVILEGES AS MEN (THINK THE RIGHT TO VOTE) 

I don't mean to get heated, but like, the very definition of feminism states that it advocates for women on the grounds of *equality*.  OP even said it.

&gt;So, before feminism can try to be equal, they have to first be unequal?
Before they can fight against disadvantages men face, they must eliminate all disadvantages women face, thus actually making women more advantaged than men by any definition?
And you still want to claim it's an attempt at equality?

Feminism isn't trying to fight the disadvantages men face.  They're trying to face the disadvantages that women face, that's literally what the movement was developed for (because women have always been and still are at a greater disadvantage then men). Them (must I reiterate, a *women's* rights school for thought, focusing on moving men up in society (when they are pretty much already at the top of the gender pyramid) is not a top priority. What I'm saying is that before feminism addresses the advantages women have (which are much, much fewer than the disadvantages) women should probably be placed a little bit closer to men on the social ladder.  Like maybe fix rape culture, pay inequality, and let me decide if I want to have an abortion or not, before feminism should be responsible for fixing men's problems.  

For example, custody being given to women in court isn't a problem of feminism.  That's the patriarchy's problem for confining women to rearing children for, I dunno, all of human history or something like that.  AKA, that's men's problem.  Like I'm all for an equal chance at custody between the sexes, but I don't think Germaine Greer should be making flyers, simply because feminism focuses on women's rights.  That isn't a women's rights issue.  Why do you expect feminism to be addressing that?  

You talk about feminism not fighting the disadvantages men face and therefore it not being equal, but you agree that feminism is about focusing on women.  I don't get it.

&gt;So, just to be clear:
Where men have advantages, it's the patriarchy and must be stopped.
Where women have advantages, it's the patriarchy so it's less important?
If feminism wants to claim to be about equality, be about equality. But when all of your ""most important"" issues exclusively benefit women, your argument lacks credibility.

No the patriarchy should be stopped either way.  But when men's rights activists complain about feminism not addressing their issues, what I'm saying is they do, but indirectly (military draft example).  All of the 'most important issues' benefit women because feminism is about making women (who are disadvantaged) the equals of men.  So yeah, a movement that focuses on making women closer to the equals of men is going to focus on the issues where women are at a disadvantage.  Think about it this way. 



                             *Men are here

                                                                   *Equality is here


* Women are here

The gap is bigger where women are.  So feminism focuses on getting women closer to the point of equality because they have a further way to go.  What's wrong with that?  Just because they don't talk about issues not related to women's rights doesn't mean they're not for equality.  How much does men's rights focus on giving women equal wages?  Does men's rights not addressing women's rights mean they're not also for equality?  They're both *subsets* fighting for gender equality by focusing on issues that relate to their gender.  Arguing that feminism isn't striving for gender equality because it focuses on women's disadvantages (which is what it's literal definition is) rather then men's, is like saying fighting for racial equality by focusing on the disadvantages of minorities and not the few disadvantages that whites have, is not equality. And frankly, that's kind of bullshit.

&gt;Ironically, though, the feminists (when it comes to specific policies) doesn't do that.
You fall back to ""our gains in other areas should fix the problems men face too"" rather than actually advocating for women to be part of the selective service.

Actually I do (and many other feminists) advocate for women to be included in selective service. Because that's equality, no? 

&gt;Address the issue or don't. Claiming that there's some tenuous ""eventual"" equalization from exclusively supporting women's interests isn't equality. The idea that you get away with saying ""I'm for equality"" by simply saying ""these things that benefit women exclusively might eventually benefit men"" would drive you up the wall in reverse.

All I was saying was that it's a bit ironic that men's rights activists whine about all these things when it's the patriarchy's fault they exist to begin with. It's not like women all of a sudden started oppressing men into thinking that women should be the ones rearing the babies and not being CEOs.  

Also that it's not fair to say that feminism doesn't fix a lot of men's rights issues, because by changing the perception/gender roles of women, they actually do.

And again, it's not feminism's job to focus on that issue because, once again, feminism is: the advocacy of *women's rights* (not men's) on the ground of the equality of the sexes


One more time:  Just because a movement devoted to reaching gender equality by focusing on *women* (the group that is at the primary disadvantage), doesn't make it somehow not for equality by not focusing on the issues of the men (AKA the consistently more powerful and oppressive gender), which has had in the past and currently has much more advantages and is responsible for thousands of years of oppression of women.



tl;dr: Feminism aims for gender equality by focusing on women's rights, not men's. That doesn't mean that it's not aiming for equality.  It's not advocating for matriarchy or trying to put men above women at all, it's a subset of gender equality.

This is why Im not a Feminist. You compare past achievements of a different movement to trivialize and marginalize current states of affairs.

Woman's Suffrage =/= Feminism

Feminism **HAS** done good, but as it stands right now it has turned into [the knight templar](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar) trope. 

Death in the workplace, Suicide, Fathers rights and education are not ""Trivial"" by any means. 

edit: 
&gt;I mean it's a near-binary system (ignoring like trans etc. for the moment), so if women's rights=men's rights, then men's rights =women's rights

How does forking out scholarships and Educational aids for women help fix the problem of Boys falling behind in school, and Men dropping out of secondary education.

How is Feminism helping men who [commit suicide at a very alarming rate](http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/06/11/mens-suicide-rate-is-3-times-that-of-women/55897.html).

How does VAWA help men who are abused at a [rate estimated to be equal to that of women.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_domestic_violence)

I dont argue that women have serious problems, but ignoring other peoples when they **NEED** help is asinine and cruel.

He said stuff like ""the guitar doesn't really need a new nut (bla bla whatever). I had bought an Earvana nut and wanted it installed.

Have you ever turned away repair work because it was either too time consuming, or too dangerous (like scalloping a neck risks messing up the whole neck etc, etc,) do shops have any sort of policy about this kind of stuff?

Thanks."

wicksa,medical,1389837300.0,"not a doctor, but im a nurse that works 12 hour night shifts. here are some things i do to get to sleep and stay asleep during the day:

* blackout curtains in the bedroom. being able to make your room dark and trick your brain into thinking its night time really helps.

* wear sunglasses on the way home.
 
* stop all caffeine by 4am (my shift ends at 0715, im usually home by 0830-9 depending how late i stay)
 
* take melatonin a half hour or so before going to bed. i take 600 mgs and it usually helps me fall asleep on days i just can't turn my brain off.
 
* benedryl, i usually take this if the melatonin isnt doing the trick. it makes me drowsy so i usually fall asleep. it can make some people hyper though!
 
* eat a small breakfast (ill usually have a bagel, yogurt or cereal) before going to bed, then your body doesnt wake up a couple hours later because you are hungry and havent eaten anything since 1am.
 
* i personally stay on the night shift schedule, even on my days off--unless i have an appointment or something i need to do during the day. this helps the most, but i know it is not really ideal for many people. i dont have any kids and my SO works 2nd shift, so we usually stay up until 3-5am and sleep until 1-2pm or so (i like my sleep). most people are getting off work around 4 or 5pm, so i am still available to hang out in the evenings and do things with friends, which is when id be hanging out with them if i worked their shift anyway! 


i hope some of this helps! night shift can be difficult to deal with socially and sleepwise, but i actually prefer it to day shift!"

Saffs15,army,1389837359.0,"In Iraq we were on a checkpoint which had jack shit on it. Guard tower, out house, and a tent to sleep in style. The PLT out there built had enough lumber to build a small DFAC building. Well there was rumors that we'd be getting a couple of computers out there and then an antennea deal for internet.

So I'm on rotation there when we get this stuff (One PLT stayed there, the other two rotated a few of there guys there to help out) and most the guys are excited about getting it all set up. The problem is, it's coming the worst fucking storm I've ever seen. But our NCOs were still wanting this done. So here we are, setting all of the stuff up in the middle of a massive ass lightning storm. I don't remember all of it (been a couple of years), but I just remember how much of a pain in the ass it was, and laughing at the fact that what we were doing was absolutely stupid. Not that we were pissed or anything, there wasn't anything else to do. Eventually the NCOs just gave up, and decided to do it the next morning.

Of course, about a week after it was finally set up, we get hit by a pretty good size VBIED, destroying all of that and the DFAC. Luckly no one was to badly hurt though."

People who publish about those topics are probably only doing thought experiments and don't require (much) funding.

You're thinking about the economics of farming, and that's good. Too many people go into this with just the idea of liking the lifestyle and having romantic notions of being near nature, independence, etc. However, I think you're looking at the wrong side of the economic equation first. Before you consider what state/province will let you keep the most of your profit you need to figure out where you can actually *make* a profit first. It's fairly easy to farm the way the Cult of Permaculture^TM advocates. What's hard is doing it profitably. In that link bruceki does a good job of breaking down how and why Salatin's numbers won't hold up for you.

So on to  location advice. You could farm like that anywhere, but you need to be close to your market. Your market needs to be 2 things 1) wealthy enough to pay a premium and 2) ideologically inclined to pay it. The roughnecks working the Bakken or up in Fort MacMurray have lots of disposable income but they aren't likely to want to pay $10/lb for pasture raised ground beef. So you need to be near a city with a large population of affluent foodies. Salatin is in northern Virginia near a lot of wealthy people. You need to find a similar location. "

rising_son,Guitar,1389837559.0,"The word ""transparency"" is just used to refer to the pedal not ""sucking"" tone, or in otherwords doing unwanted compression or tone shaping. In my opinion it should NOT be used as a descriptive adjective to indicate quality. A good pedal should not kill your tone, regardless of Digital or Analogue design. I believe it is used too loosely as a positive adjective to describe the intended effect of a pedal. For example, one should say ""the pedal's circuitry does not add any unwanted compression or EQ curve to the signal."" not ""the pedal is transparent and does not colour your tone"".

Edit: Wanted to add, I think what transparent means is that if I feed in a quacky inbetween singlecoil sound, I still want to hear the guitar's OWN tonal quality out the other end. I think the term  ""transparent"" really means pedals that respond to both dynamics and the guitars' own sound, and preserve it as much as possible."

It shows when they bought the product and which product they purchased.  However, the computer programs are not locally connected so you only have history on your own customers.  If someone shops at another store and came to mine without a receipt, usually I will ask when it was purchased.  Depending on the answer I may or may not return it.  Most of the time, I advise the customer to return it the store that they usually frequent because prices vary from store to store.

---

Honestly, I prefer it this way. It's hard enough to fire someone who sucks at their job, because HR departments usually make it very difficult to fire anyone (to protect the company against lawsuits for unreasonable or unlawful termination).

It's even harder to fire someone for doing a shitty job when you don't have at-will employment. I know of someone who has been trying to fire someone for almost a year, collecting evidence against this person. This person also takes excessive time off. As in, he will call in on a Friday and say ""I'm going to be out sick all next week"" and there isn't much the company (which isn't in the US) can do about it. 

In the meantime, a bunch of us have to pick up the guy's slack because he's terribly incompetent even when he IS at work."

But I went back for my 6 month check in after I got implanon, and the other GYN there has his own private clinic where he specifically treats women who are obese, He's a PCOS specialist, and he said regardless of what he see's, he will  officially refer me to the endometriosis centre in the main city!!
