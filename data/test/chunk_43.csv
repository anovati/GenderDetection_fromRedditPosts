Guy blares on the horn while my fiance and her two friends are loading the car. After about 15 solid seconds without letting off the horn I see the girls are getting nervous so I get out of the car and say ""What is you problem?

The_Stann,darksouls,1389935179.0,"I agree with Donixs, Astora's SS is a very bad weapon unless you're taking on the Catacombs early.

Without seeing your stats, it's difficult to suggest an alternative. If you're investing in Dex, the Silver Knight Straight Sword drops from the Silver Knights in Anor Londo, and has a high base damage at +5. It can also be buffed with magic or resin for good damage.

If you're focused on Strength, the Butcher Knife that Maneater Mildred drops is decent, or the Man-Serpent Greatsword that's dropped by manserpents in Sen's Fortress.

If all else fails, you can upgrade a normal weapon to +5 and get the blacksmith in the Catacombs to ascend it to fire, Ornstein and Smough are rather weak against fire. Remember that you can always leave Anor Londo and do some of the other content before taking on O&amp;S, I consider them to be the hardest boss fight before the DLC.

Instead, go speak with an attorney.  The reason why you weren't arrested on the spot is because they don't have enough evidence to arrest you.  If you go to the questioning, they will.  Stay the fuck away.

SirJefferE,AskReddit,1389935517.0,"&gt;I don’t want to get in trouble, not because I feel it is morally wrong.

I don't know. I'm halfway on this one.

If I thought I could become a burglar for a few weeks with absolutely zero consequences, I would do it in a heartbeat. Something about sneaking around appeals to me, and I think I could probably do the job very well. I know I shouldn't be satisfied at being a professional burglar, but I think I would be.

The reason I don't do something like that is partly because I don't want to suffer *any* of the consequences, but the other part is that I don't want the people I'd burglarize to suffer either.

Moving on down the line from bad to worse, I don't think I would ever kill anybody. If I knew I could make a lot of money from it, if I really didn't like the person, if I knew there was no possible way I could get in trouble from it, etc. There's just no real situation where I would actually go out and kill someone who isn't directly threatening me, my family, or some other innocent.

There are other things that, while not entirely legal, are done every single day by multiple people, and I refuse to do some of those things based entirely on my own morals. Driving is the first thing that comes to mind. I am the most patient driver I know. I won't run a red light, I won't speed, I won't get unduly upset if someone cuts me off, and I'll let people merge or pass even if they're entirely in the wrong and it inconveniences me to do so.

There's no direct benefit in that kind of thing for me, but I do it anyways, and it keeps me happy.

Overall, I believe you pretty much make your own morals, and then you combine them with societal laws and kind direct your behavior accordingly (Act certain ways because you morally believe it is the right way to act, act other ways not because of your morals but because society expects it and there are consequences to not acting that way)."

*And then... the ground starts to move. A large area where the various weapons lie, 15 feet in diameter, starts to form cracks. It begins to shift, the area rising out of the ground. It holds still, a circular plateau.*  
  
*In truth, it is a large disk of stone, 15 feet wide and 10 feet thick. And right now, between it and the ground is Orville, holding it up with one hand. His legs are curled up into a ball position, his feet standing on top of his other hand, which is touching the ground.

dakru,AskMen,1389936087.0,"&gt; My husband is tall, dark haired and handsome. If you are a short blonde average looking guy, will telling you this help you in any way?

It contributes to letting him accurately understand women's preferences.

Let's focus on height as an example. Women generally have a preference for tall men. This isn't right or wrong, but it is true. Should we downplay the extent to which this is true when talking to short guys because they can't change their height? I don't think so. If we make them think height doesn't matter then they're actually going to think it doesn't matter, and then when they enter a world where it does matter they're going to be confused.

&gt; Do we really have to say that being rude or very overweight is not usually an asset? I'd assume that was widely known.

It goes much further than that, though. There are all sorts of things that help a man's success with women including having charisma, being able to stand up for yourself, being funny, having social status, being exciting, being ambitious, being able to tease and flirt, etc. None of these things get the same level of attention as kindness does in women's dating advice to men. And yes, the result is that tons of men really don't know the importance of having (at least) some of these traits.

&gt; This is where the dreaded ""Be Yourself"" comes in. If you are a macho sports loving meat eater and find a survey that says 75% of women prefer sensitive vegetarian poets, you could of course, take up vegetarianism and poetry, but you're probably not going to like them much.

Vegetarianism and poetry are specific interests, and it hasn't been my experience that having these (or any other specific interests) really play much of a role in a man's success with women in general. It's the various personal and social traits that I listed above that play a big role, and all of these can be worked on and achieved (to some extent). I consider working on those traits to be a case of self-improvement just like losing weight, although if someone says that not being a pushover or not being fat isn't the ""real me"" then that's their choice.

&gt; You'd do better to concentrate your efforts on the other 25% of women. The goal after all is to find someone compatible with you. 

But if we're talking about 75% of men, for example, then they can't all date the 25% of women.

&gt; Gaining a bit of confidence and trying to be a bit kinder could be useful.

Honestly, how many guys who don't do well with women are in that situation because they're not kind enough? The problem for most of them is that they focus on kindness to the exclusion of everything else. I'm not going to argue that kindness isn't good in a partner, but most of them have that trait down pretty darn well. We don't need them focusing on it *even more*. We need them learning about the importance of traits they neglect."

The way to reconcile these two statements is by acknowledging that it was good for the US to engage in war with Japan - that was the only way to prevent further Japanese war crimes in Asia.

I do indeed know, and said as much ;)

I suspect the major difference between you and I, is that there comes a point in a domestic violence incident where I would choose to directly intervene. If there's shouting and carrying on, and it looked to be escalating to the point of violence, I might step in and ask the perceived weaker party if everything was ok, and based on their response (note: deliberately gender neutral here) choose to involve myself further, or back off. If I saw someone winding up to take a swing, I don't think I could in good conscience just stand by and dial the police.

mundabit,Cooking,1389936400.0,"Was she in England during the 80's? My mum always blames this for her constant over-cooking of meat. I eat my steak blue, she eats hers .... 'well done' doesn't even explain it, if its not 20% of its original size, completely black and crispy, its not cooked.

I'm a maniac in the kitchen. I never measure anything, ever, Not even when trying a new recipe, I just glance at it, get a general idea of the flavours I want then go for it. Sucks to be me if I want to re-create it exactly, but after 5 times making it I end up with it ingrained in my head.

I use whatever tool is on hand to do a job, it might not always been the right one. I learned to cook from my grandma and she taught me the right way, but I really grew as a home cook when I went camping with my dad and was allowed to have full control over the cooking process. Often you;d be using sticks to stir things or using a Bowie knife to do literately everything from pearing fruit to testing the doneness of meat, to whittling the stick you plan to use to stir.

I only have one major issue in the kitchen, and that's cross-contamination. I have allergies myself, I have always had at least one friend with allergies, and I do make cakes for a living, so while I may get lazy and use a liquid jug to measure flour, That jug gets sterilized before it gets put back, then steralized before it gets used again, on the off chance I get someone with celiacs ordering a cake. I also have a rule when I'm catering for others, that if I am dealing with raw meat, I wash my hands in the bathroom sink, then again in the kitchen sink. that way the kitchen sink never gets raw meat  on the taps.

With all that said, When I'm just cooking for myself, I'd make myself cry if I saw it from third person. I have eaten off the floor, licked my chopping board clean, used a 5 day old unwashed tea cup to make another cup of tea. That's why I have my own personal crockery and cutlery, because I know its foul."

dementeddr,AskReddit,1389936444.0,"Cones are the cells in your eyes that can detect color. They are really good at sharp details and colors, but don't work very well at low light levels. They are also make up almost all of the cells in the center of your retina, where the light at your focal point falls. Rods are the cells that detect darkness and brightness. They don't do details very well, but can pick out differences in brightness pretty well. That allows you to see at least the outline of things in the dark better. They make up the majority of the retina outside of your focal point.

So, when you look directly at something when in low light, most of the very little light is falling on those cones that don't do low light well. By looking slightly away, that light falls more on the rods, which can pick it out better.

terabyte06,WTF,1389936502.0,"Feel free to look up your state's school lunch requirements, but in my state, it has nothing to do with calories, and everything to do with nutritional value as you stated.  Junk foods and empty-calorie foods are banned outright, and high-fat or high-sugar foods are limited in portion.  

Now, the USDA's federal ruling on calorie limits make perfect sense.  If you eat 600 calories for breakfast, and 850 calories for lunch, that's 1450 calories.  Your average high schooler needs somewhere around 2100 calories per day.  The largest meal of the day is dinner.  Assuming you'd eat another 850 calories then, you'd be well over the 2100 calorie mark.  Again, that's assuming no soda, candy, and what-not, and a small dinner. 

You're completely right that kids need a certain amount of calories per day, which is exactly where these numbers come from.  If they were on a weight loss diet, the average calories would drop to 1800 or less per day.  

And you're right that spending more money on the quality of school lunches is a good idea.  But increasing the calorie count of a school lunch beyond that of a Double Whopper isn't a good idea.  Calories are still the bottom-line in weight control."

It should go without saying that you gotta do this when the car is cold.  Since you have a Civic this is gonna be painless.  You're gonna need to let the car sit over night.  Get a bucket... a big one.  You're gonna have to drain your coolant.  There's a small bolt on the backside of your radiator, undo it and you're gonna have about a gallon of coolant drain out.  Undo the clamp on the upper radiator hose and pull it from the radiator, bend it out of the way.   After that remove the plug from the radiator fan.  Unbolt the radiator fan and take it out, you're probably going to have to be pretty forceful with it.  Yank it out of there.   Next undo the clamps on the lower radiator hose, remove it from the radiator.  Next undo the radiator bolt up top, make sure everything is out of the way and simply pull it out.  Put your mishimoto down in there, put the bolt on top. Slide the old clamps off the hoses and put the new ones on.  Push the lower hose on the radiator and tighten the clamp down, not to tight but more forceful than snug.  Push the fan down in there and bolt it up.  Don't put the plug in it.  Put the upper radiator hose on and tighten the clamp.  Plug in the radiator.  

As for burping the radiator...  

If you can park on a slight incline with the car at an upwards angle.  Fill the radiator with coolant/water until it reaches the top.  Leave the cap off the radiator.  Turn on the car and let it run with the cap off, after 15-20 minutes a majority off the coolant will get sucked into the engine.  You'll need to fill it again.  It may do it one to two more times after that as well.  After 45 minutes to an hour it will simply begin to boil out.  At this point all the air bubbles should of come out of the coolant system.  You can shut the car off, put the cap on the radiator (carefully, it's hot!) and you should be good to go!  "

Maybe banned subs are banned because they get overwhelmed and wrecked by trolls and it's sensitive to PC crowd. Maybe this sub might be banned to if it got taken over by trolls and the PC crowd found out about it. But it's a much more legit serious topic than /r/niggers.

RadiumGirl,OkCupid,1389936696.0,"&gt;Ogling is just looking at a woman.

No, ogling is to 'stare at in a lecherous manner' or to 'stare at impertinently, flirtatiously, or amorously'. 

&gt;Would you prefer it if, when you go out in public, all men avert their eyes?

So, you think the only two options are 'ogling' and 'completely averting ones eyes'? 

&gt;You are claiming that ogling is a negative response that should be controlled. The only way to do that is to completely emasculate men so that they refuse to look at you at all times.

Ogling *is* a negative response and it *can* be controlled - and doing so in no way emasculates anybody. The fact that you think telling a man not to ogle a women in some way emasculates him is very troubling.

&gt;Unless you think a that no woman has a choice in the clothing she wears. Then I don't know what to say to you.

What are you even talking about? I *never* said that. I said that men (and women if they're doing it - and I'm sure some do) absolutely have the ability to control their desire to ogle."

Last time I think they misjudged the situation and tried to do the right thing rather than the thing most of the people who voted for them wanted, leading to people feeling short-changed, although it seems a bit unfair to blame them for believing people were voting for them rather than as a proxy for Labour.

Last time it seemed like the country was fed up with Labour and propping them up would not have gone down well. They would have been seen to have been ignoring the will of the voters, but they had pick between that the reaction they could expect if they aligned with the Conservatives. I'm sure they felt it was the lesser of two evils but perhaps they underestimated the strenth of feeling.

The Conservatives won a lot more seats than Labour too, would it have been right to have turned the loser into the victor? It would also have had practical implications. A Lab/Lib government would have had fewer seats and that might have made things a lot harder for them to get things done.

I can see things being different next time. I think there's a lot of buyers remorse with Cameron, although there always is with voters, and the Conservatives generally. It could give the Lib Dems justification for aligning with Labour, especially if Labour won the majority of seats or were at least closer. As it stands though, Labour might win outright."

1kachan,Conservative,1389937028.0,"&gt; Maxed out immigration and to some extent the temporary foreign worker program are things that are seen as the norm here. 

You are absolutely right about that, just like Universal Health Care, which is considered the norm here that no party dare touch because its political suicide, but I digress. 

Returning to immigration, I had no idea the immigration process here in Canada was so bureaucratic until I met my fiancée in University and we started the process. It is a lot more complicated than I personally feel it ought to be, although I do acknowledge that immigration in Canada is primarily around a prospective immigrants potential contribution to Canada (cultural and economic). I also acknowledge that at 250,000/year, we are letting in a lot of people, even with the heavy regulation. 

Personally, I just wish that the process was a little easier in Canada for those that DO meet the criteria. Immigrating here is a lot harder than the multicultural mantra we are so accustomed to hearing. 

Even the sponsorship program is costly and lengthy, and there is no guarantee.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389937073.0,"If you live in Chicago and take public transportation, as I do, trying to look nice in your winter apparel becomes a really low priority. In particular, you need a hat and there is really no way to wear one without messing up your hurr. The only thing that sort of helps is doing a low pony tail that's sort of swept to the side. 

There is really no substitute for warm snow boots, and they are not sexy at all. If you live where it doesn't get that cold, then you can do fine with thick socks and fashionable boots, but no way for me. When it's not too cold you can wear tights or jeans in your boots and look fashionable. When it's super cold, though, I don't have anything remotely attractive to wear for bottoms. I just wear sweatpants with tights underneath, thick socks with legwarmers wrapped around my  knees, and then my snow boots. Jeans simply will not cut it. So in that sense I think it is impossible to look attractive. I just hope my face makes up for it. However, that is hard when all your snot freezes and then when you go inside it drips down your face.

Edit: In all seriousness though, I have a few sweater dresses that make me look smoking hot. One is a cowl neck so it has extra warmth around the neck while still revealing cleavage. BAM!  It's made out of wool so it is really warm. As long as it's above 15-20 degrees, I can wear it. I got it at on super sale from Ann Taylor and it's my go-to going out dress in the winter. "

For example, I might go out for coffee with a girl, we hang out all day, and I genuinely enjoy their company. The problem is that I seem to just lose interest. I'll text them for a few days and then up and quit for no reason whatsoever. 

Lately I've been trying to figure out why I do this so much and I think I might just be fucked in the head... Part of me believes (no matter how much I like them) that if I were to get into a committed relationship, someone else could come along that I like way more and I would be stuck/unavailable. I know this makes me a total asshole but I really can't help it.

I picked up bass to play in my middle school's talent show, and since then it's just been a natural progression of getting bored and band practice and playing the drum set. And I got jealous of those sweet ass guitar solos. I play mostly alone, but I really like to jam when I get the possibility.

Biggest obstacle for me is never being sure if a girl's coming onto me or just being friendly, and being afraid to offend her in cases where it's ambiguous. I don't like to take risks, basically.

The solution for you to is to always be direct. Since most girls shy away from asking dudes out they instead resort to hint-dropping. That doesn't work on the Shy Guy usually. You have to give him no reason to doubt that you're attracted to him. Seen that one pic from Family Guy with the air-traffic controller directing towards a girl's crotch? That's basically what you should do.

Your own shyness/awkwardness can be made into a boon since you're a girl (though I know it works the other way around sometimes, obviously, since you're posting this).

Hiei2k7,stlouisblues,1389937658.0,"As an objective fan, here's what I saw. 

1st goal was a quick flick.  Early goal.  From then on the blues pushed the physical play up to 11.  Unfortunately, they only continued to keep hitting instead of clearing the way for the 1st line and others to score. Blues end the period out hitting the kings by a ton.  Regehr won the fight with Jackman.

2nd period the chances start coming and oshie gets the penalty shot.  Quick fails on a half assed poke check. 1-1.  Physical play continues. Progressively through this period the blues go from hitting to generate chances to hitting just to hit.  Reaves is out there just looking for a fight the back half of the period which bites the team in the ass when he gets penalized at the end of the period. If you will note, Reaves wasn't out much if at all in the third.  Hitchcock must've seen what Reaves was doing and dressed him down during intermission. 

3rd period started with a quick tally after the pp expired.  It was a bit of a runner situation but they scored nonetheless. Then comes the bungle... after all that hitting and everything that bungle took a lot of steam out of the team and as much as they tried Quick had every answer, including that juggler toward the end of the game.  Sloppy line changes and an empty netter with more pileups at the end.

It would make a super interesting series should they meet in the playoffs.

TotallyNotSuperman,AskScienceFiction,1389937706.0,"People in this thread are talking a lot about Batman, so I'm going to spend most of my comment talking about Superman.

See, here's the difference between Batman and Superman: Batman tries to be scary. Superman tries to *not* be scary. Batman is a guy who can be killed by a lucky bullet, so he needs to make sure that everyone is too scared of him to shoot straight. Superman is a guy who can kill anyone at any time without the slightest possibility of consequences, so he needs to make sure that nobody ever thinks that he would do so.

Superman has all the power in the world, and he knows it. That's why he gives interviews, smiles for photo ops, and does a lot for charity. Well, he'd do the charity thing anyway, but it's a reason he's so public about it. He wants everyone to know that he has nothing but their best interests at heart.

And he needs to. Think about this. Who is *the* superhero? If you said Batman, you're wrong. When people think superhero, they think of Superman. He's the ambassador; his actions not only reflect himself, but the entire superhero community. If he's scary, suddenly people are afraid of Green Lantern, Flash, Wonder Woman, and every other person who tries to stop a mugging while wearing a mask.

Batman is rarely seen by anyone but criminals, so it's fine if he's frightening. He wants to frighten criminals. Superman is constantly being seen by the world, so he *can't* frighten them. He's a symbol, and a symbol of fear is counter to everything he's trying to accomplish.

That's not to say that Superman can't be scary. Flash has mentioned that Superman has a habit of floating a few feet above the ground, staring at bad guys with eyes filled with fire. Most give up immediately, and not all of them do so with clean pants. I'm not kidding. According to Wally West, Superman makes bad guys shit their pants.

Heck, just look at [this](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/HeroAntagonist.jpg).

tattedspyder,technology,1389937741.0,"It's kind of hard to be firmly on one side or the other.

On the one hand, there are plenty of things in your car that can be in front of you but don't impair your concentration at all.  As long as it's not directly impairing your vision, or in the case of electronic devices (phones, screens, etc) you're not actually using it while driving then there's nothing wrong with having it in your field of view.  So it's ok to wear the Glass if it's not on.

On the other hand there's no way to really prove that someone *isn't* actively using their Glass and being distracted while driving since the cop can't really tell and someone can just switch it off if they are getting pulled over.  So it's safer to say that you're not allowed to wear them at all while driving.

He turns, looks and points right at me and yells back, ""Shut up, you little bitch!"" I made the same exact expression as the guy in this gif.

topdnbass,summonerschool,1389937786.0,"I'm open to constructive criticism. However, I think you may be misinterpreting a bit.  
To start, I play mid/jungle more than bot, so I am not just picking favorites. This post is the result of a lot of research and observation.  
As a note, when I talk about bot lane, I'm talking about the lane itself. Not just the people laning in it, or the laning phase.  
This would be equally true if 2v1 swapping.  
    
I'm not saying the other lanes are not important, but they don't allow you to apply pressure and obtain objectives throughout the game quite as well as bot lane does this season.  
If top lane wins lane hard, sure they might be able to roam and make plays, but unless they help out bot lane, they aren't going to get the team good dragon control.  
Also they will probably lose their tier 1 turret because top laners tend to push all day. Overall a big risk.  
Of course this is multifaceted, the top laner could also draw the jungler top, which would help bot lane/jungler/mid to get dragon, assuming their counterparts aren't too ahead.  
This is just not as reliable as what I talk about.  
Same with mid, they can kill the enemy laner and take turret, but if they go to take drag it would still be risky.   
Now say your gragas ganks bot gets a double and then helps dragon, now that's a good way to win.

&gt; There is no way that a bot lane can just go and push down their inhib in laning phase or even after. It takes 5v5 fights and a lot of map control to accomplish this.

Of course, this would require communication. When you are deciding where to push as a team, don't just default to mid. It is of more strategic value to push and take the bottom inhib, because this pressures the furthest area from baron.  
Eventually someone has to deal with the overwhelming bot lane pressure, opening up room for baron plays or just winning 5v4 teamfights.

&gt; Most of your argument relies on every lane winning or at least breaking even which rarely happens in solo queue. Also, you have to account for the fact that their team has a jungler who wants to gank lanes as much as your own jungler.

The beauty of taking advantage of bot lane pressure is that it's the most effective way by far to get consistent global gold. This means even if top and mid get dumpstered, they can still be ahead in gold.

There are other factors of course, but in the current meta/season, what happens bot lane affects the outcome of the game more than any other lane. To me this is simply fact for the reasons I've outlined. Of course that's assuming similar skill levels. If your top is way more skilled he can do more with an advantage.  
If your adc just gets caught then all that was for nothing.  
Even still the map pressure and global gold would make prioritizing bot lane a good choice."

This has allowed me to create dishes that are FAR more flavorful than what I could normally find in the area and are much more nutritionally balanced and healthy.  I cook different things in each of the crockpots, so I alternate between the two for my meals.  Overall, I spend at most 40$ every two weeks on these lunches.  Two large crockpots and enough tupperware to hold everything would probably run you about 60-70$, but crockpots are a godsend.  If you wanted to, you could just buy one crockpot, cook one meal on saturday and clean it, then one on sunday and then clean it again.

as much salt + pepper as you like. I use kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.  


Takes about 30 minutes to prepare and another 8 hours to cook. I recommend doing it in the morning so the amazing smell doesn't wake you up.  
1. Start browning the ground beef in a large pan or wok. Add a good amount of pepper and salt (less if the canned vegetables are high sodium). Start chopping up all the fresh vegetables when you put the ground beef in the pan. You shouldn't need oil. Start with onions.  
2. Throw the chopped vegetables into the pan as the beef is cooking.  
3. While the beef finishes browning, put all the beans, canned tomatoes, salt, pepper, garlic chili sauce (optional), spices, and tomato paste in the slow cooker.  
4. When the beef finishes, put it all in the slow cooker.  
5. Mix. Set the slow cooker for 8 hours on LOW.  
6. Wait.  
7. Add salt and pepper to taste.  
8. Eat. Serve with parmesan cheese.

All my friends are from school; people who I know because I had to, and although they are great people and I love them, I notice that most of them don't seem to understand that the things I say are not meant to offend. I'm a smart guy, and a very peculiar guy, and I recognise it simply because everyone else does, but I often find people who see my words as arrogance. I'm not arrogant; in fact, for years I was looking for ways to get rid of my brain so I could be normal, until I finally gave up and accepted I can't ever be. But people expect me to lower myself, to never show any uncommon talent. I can't do that, I have tried so hard but I can't. Talking to the opposite gender is not difficult for me; what is, is behaving like a normal person would in normal situations. Even now, I can see how misinterpreted can be this comment, like if I were saying that I'm smarter than Reddit. I'm not, I know my limits.

okay, stereotypes, well, there are worse things...

 &gt;I would assume that most bisexual women specifically would be less likely to be attracted to ""alphas"" because they are also attracted to women and there are no prescribed gender roles in gay relationships.

uhhh...

&gt;I have a dyke friend (I mean that in as nice of a way as possible) who 

actually, I'm pretty sure you don't... 

 &gt;games girls as hard as any dude I've seen and has never been with a guy. I mean, of all the human beings alive that I know, I respect her game a mile more than what anyone else is bringing.
 Funny thing happened as the friendship moved along . . . she started dropping unsubtle hints that she'd love to take a shot a me. For example, the last time I saw her pick up a girl she told me, ""You should join us.""

...and now I'm sure of it. 

&gt;It's an anecdote, sure, 

hahahahaha

&gt;but I do find it interesting that when she met a guy whose game she could respect, suddenly there was at least one guy who might be worth her interest. I also knew a hetero girl a while back who was so twisted in knots by her relationship with me that she went bi for a while until her girlfriend basically told her to cut the shit and just accept that she was still pining for me and that she wasn't really bi.

msing,asianamerican,1389938318.0,"I'm a bit biased on this language requirement. The reason, is at least off my understanding about Chinese culture, is that anyone who knows the language comprehensively (speaking/reading/writing at least 3,000 characters) is predisposed by the Chinese community to be welcomed, and embraced if the person acts out on Confucian thought. The person's race, class, gender wealth has no bearing. This facet has been used to explain why China has been able to assimilate so many different ethnic groups over history, (but this shouldn't be the only reason to explain history.)

This isn't necessary the case with all Asian cultures -- say Japanese who have a history of separating nikkeijin (Japanese diaspora) from the general community, or South Asians who have a large religious distinction (Thinking of Punjab in particular, that if all else between the people are the same, and from the same heritage, a Hindu and a Muslim will have disagreements).

On a broader perspective though, it just happens that many Asian languages are rather difficult to learn, so that if anyone is able to break that barrier, they would be wholly appreciated. This is reflected in many cultures, where language fluency is widely appreciated. Imagine the much better reception of speaking native French in France, or native Finnish in Finland. The person is simply better welcomed. Language (family) isolates from Asia off the top of my head include Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Dravidian, and the distantly related Austroasiatic families, that require a complete study, isntead of relating the grammar or vocabulary from a related language family. In my review of Tagalog -- by speaking to my Filipino-American friends learning it in college, it's appears incredibly complex, conjugated and more unintuitive than any other language I've seen before. (VSO/VOS word order is what I was thinking of)

Then again, the Filipino people are rather welcoming, and maybe have other priorities associated with being culturally Filipino, than culturally Asian. If anything there's a nationalistic component that I did not mention before with all Asian cultures, such that they might allow anyone to become Filipino if they only accept the nationality of Filipino and no other competing culture/nation. This would be complemented with embracing the Filipino mentality which I imagine is more family oriented, yet a more relaxed mentality than what I described in Confucian ideologies. From my personal observations, Filipinos tend to network to form tight knit communities faster and more comprehensive than other Asian American groups.

There's a reason they only seem to mostly appear on hands and feet.

For what it's worth, my daughter had warts all over her hands, and we tried multiple times to use the dry ice method over, God, about 2 years.

In the end I fixed her warts by using the gaffa tape method. I swear to god it works.

You have to get some good strong gaffa tape that'll stick on all day. We tried three types of tape before we found something suitable. It has to be something that'll form an airtight seal and then be non-breathable.

Then we just put tape on every single day for about 4 weeks. Within 1 week we were seeing the warts start to die. It took about 8 weeks for all of her various different warts to be finished, but it was totally worth it. Honest to goodness, the gaffa tape method is totally effective. It's one of those old wive's tales that actually WORKS."

The Asia/Europe continental stemmed from a cultural divide - a idea that we couldn't possible be on the same continent as those barbarians, and that idea was introduced as science, but there's really no logical reason to say that they're separate continents.

Roll 1d4, either randomly determined by dm when it happens, or a small percentage roll done at players request (more fun when controlled by dm).

* if 1, the player sneezes, teleporting them ten feet, opposite the direction of the sneeze.

* if 2, the player farts, casting a spell with effects similar to noxious gas, affecting all allies and enemies.

* if 3, the player coughs, causing the knockdown effect (vs as str of 20) for all creatures within a 15 feet cone range in front of them.

* if 4, the player belches, causing the spell, obscuring mist to be cast surrounding the player.

Feel free to add more specifics to it, or even more effects (hiccups causing levitate ala Charlie and the chocolate factory?)!

(You might get lucky and see a W next to the size when it's a women's plus size.) You can usually tell which stores sell junior sizes because they are very young looking. But I think more sell women's plus sizes than junior.

How the two sizes differ is that junior sizes are designed for younger women who are expected to have smaller chests, tummies, and hips. That's why the 3x is fitting you where you would wear a smaller size elsewhere... Because it's a junior plus-size.

By the way, I think 1x is about the equivalent of a size 14. I used to think it was a size 20, so knowing that kinda blew my mind.

The difference between the Sportline and the Proline (the metal one) is the material of the receivers, the spring, the motor, and the Proline comes with the QD suppressor. Other than those four things, they are identical. 

I actually took mine to a field last weekend, preformed great. Could do with a slightly stronger spring but that is one of the benefits of the split gearbox system, it is pretty trivial to change the spring out and if you wanted you could have entire different upper gearboxes for field and CQB games.

That all being said, if you have the money for the Proline get it. If you can only afford the Sportsline it is not a bad compromise, especially since you can spend about a hundred bucks later to upgrade the body to metal."

Buffalo fits your criteria pretty well but theyve been to multiple super bowls (won 0) and they dont have a MLB team.


Since you're in Russia I'd recommend the Seahawks (dont worry about being a bandwagonn fan....seattles also an amazing town, and they have an MLB team)

If you didnt dislike CA I'd recommend the 9ers since SF is amazing, the Giants are good, the SJ Sharks are amazing...but the 9ers have also been good basically since 1980 (and won 5 super bowls) so that doesnt really fall in to your criteria

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389938894.0,"I come to TRP from a very different starting point than most guys seem to. I started out with a lot of the aloof jerk game that you'll see the big bloggers promoting. I can actually thank my ninth grade crush for that, because she was nice enough to ignore me when I asked her out then went full retard when I started ignoring her. (Protip: you know you have her properly whipped when she starts laying her head on your desk in the middle of class all of the time hoping that you'll play with her hair. Additional protip: every now and then leave a stack of books there so huge she has nowhere to lay her head so that she knows the fuckin score.)

Funny thing is, for many years I thought there was something wrong with me! As if somehow there was something broken about the idea that if you ignored chicks that an army of them would actually go completely stupid in love with you. Dumb in retrospect.

Anyhow . . . I started looking for advice on how to get better with women, and then I noticed that a lot of the advice amounted ""Do exactly what you've been doing, champ.""

Then I got into the TRP stuff and started reading all of the stuff about how women respond, and time and again I was like, ""Holy shit! That's So-and-so Whatshername! That's what she did like ten years ago!"" 

For example, I remember this super cute, kinda dumpy girl that I was stuck on my sophomore year of college. I did everything in my power to impress her and she treated me like shit to show for it. Eventually I accepted the truth of it, and end up involved with this tall, skinny, exotic-looking mixed race girl. And sure enough, suddenly the dumpy girl -- who is by this point engaged -- starts dropping the sluttiest and most unsubtle hints you've ever heard and then blowing it off like, ""I guess I really shouldn't say things like that.""

So, for me it was a case of looking back on all of those experiences and saying to myself, ""Wait a second. I'm worried there's something wrong with me, and here are all these guys writing these manuals that basically say to act like a superjerk version of me . . . WTF?""

And then I started looking at everything. My parents' relationship, which I never understood before TRP. My slutty sister and the mess she made of her life -- four kids to four dads, complete with one son for the beta provider she married just as she hit the wall (bonus TRP slut warning: she fucked her husband's dad during their engagement period!!). My sister-in-law and her unflinching attachment to my jerkboy, fuck-up failure of a brother.

There just comes a point where I tallied up all the examples in my own life and said, ""Fuck it. TRP wins."""

1kachan,canada,1389939212.0,"Hey! My fiancée and I are going through this now. Let me begin by saying that you will quickly discover how bureaucratic and complex Canada's immigration system is, even though we gloat about multiculturalism and a high immigration number (250,000/year), we do not have open border immigration. 

The vast majority of the immigrants let into this country get in through the temporary foreign workers program -- which itself is not a direct pathway to permanent residency, although it helps. A lot of people are also let in through family sponsorship, although that has long processing times and unless you are patient and have family in Canada, it isn't an option. 

If you are a skilled worker, it shouldn't be too hard to get into Canada for work. Luckily Americans do not need a tourist visa to visit Canada for period of no longer than 6 months, so if you want to get a feel for this place prior to working, you could do that. 

Some advice since I assume you are a specialist and skilled worker, choose the city you move to wisely. My fiancée and I met in Ottawa in school when she was an exchange student and while we love Ottawa, the job prospects for her here are pretty bad because it is a government town and most of the jobs in her field either require government clearance (which will not be allocated to non-Canadians), or bilingual which she is not because she doesn't speak french. 

We have therefore chosen to move to Calgary because her job is in high demand out there and they have a shortage there.

itsnotgoingtohappen,RandomActsOfPolish,1389939281.0,"Yeah, definitely don't use Seche vite as a base coat. It's designed to be smooth and protective, not to mention that it works best when it's applied on top of still-tacky polish because that facilitates bonding.

What happened here is that the Seche vite didn't have anything to bond to, chemically speaking, so instead of keeping the polish on the nails, it dried in such a way that it just sat on top of the nail and thus peeled off. Does this make sense?

My advice: use Seche clear or an actual designated base coat for your nails always. Base &amp; top coats serve two different purposes: base coats bond polish to the nail, so they're formulated for the nail beds themselves. Top coats are a protective cover, so they're formulated to bond with nail polish and create a hard outer coat."

Either both of you are immature or you just bring out the worst in each other when you're together. It's probably a little of both. 
      
Since this is your post, I'll direct my advice at you. You need to reevaluate the way you relate to other people. You come off as selfish and insensitive, even when you're trying to paint yourself in a good light here. First of all, you can't pick movies just because you assume she'll like them and then claim that she picked the movie. Even if they're movies you don't want to watch, even if you picked them with her in mind, *you* were the one who picked them. When she actually picked movies herself, you shot them down, which led to the argument. When you calculate how many movies you've picked out of the ones you two have watched, you can't add in the ones that you picked for her. How did you know she actually wanted to watch them? You're not giving her any freedom or choice here. 
     
Also, what you said to her about guys not wanting to date girls over 30 is just plain douchey. Who the fuck cares about SMV? Why would she want to hear about that? It sounds like you're insecure and wanted to keep her insecure too. This is not how you treat someone that you love. 
      
I skimmed the rest because it was pretty much unreadable, but it sounds like you two need to work on learning how to resolve arguments rather than squabbling over who is right and who is wrong. "

TaylorS1986,AskReddit,1389939333.0,"This is because a lot of English teachers themselves grew up learning grammatical and usage rules by rote and never learned the linguistic basis behind them. Also, a lot of those rules were completely made up out of whole cloth by 18th century grammar Nazis who thought English should be more like Latin out of some absurd belief that Latin is some supremely logical language and do not fit at all how English and other Germanic languages work. Hence the BS about not ending sentences with a preposition, because in Germanic languages prepositions have an adverbal quality inherited from Proto-Indo-European.

I think English class also needs some basic Linguistics as part of it."
oniongasm,MensRights,1389939333.0,"&gt; In all my years no guy has ever mentioned you can have a hard on while you're uncomfortable or that they've had unwanted sexual experiences with girls except there's supposedly 1 in 6 men that have.

That's the power of social pressure for you! We're socialized to either glorify sexual encounters (dude, see her? yeah. tapped that.), minimize them (she was a dead fish), or act as though they didn't happen.

I am the poster boy for privilege. White male in a STEM field from an affluent, undivided family. I'm a big guy at 6'4"", 240lb and pretty lean at that. I weigh twice what many women do. I'm also vocal about my intentions and wishes. That doesn't mean my sexual life has been incident free.

Exhibit A: Go out for St. Paddy's day to my usual haunt. Run into some friends, who are with this girl. Quickly realize she's into me. I'm not into her. Two bars later and I'm near blacked out. 

I remember saying No. No to a ride home while in the bar. No while outside. No to her coming in. No at the door. No in bed, which was briefly circumvented with lips thrown at mine. Then no, I'm going to sleep. I was woken multiple times with this person I barely knew trying to flip me over. I was a cat with its claws in the carpet.

I am by nature non-confrontational. I know my strength. I'm not gonna be mean or violent when things go wrong, even while drunk. I'm not physically threatened by anyone, really. But that doesn't mean I can't end up with a stranger in my bed trying to take advantage of me regardless of what I say. There is no question of consent. I denied mine.

&gt; I know there's no universal working battle plan and it depends on the guy *but I feel like some men would be offended* that I would imply I could rape them. 

What's the saying? ""ASSUME makes an ASS out of U an ME."" Do you want to keep the kid gloves on when dealing with a potential life partner or do you want to be able to be honest, open, and straightforward?

&gt; Frankly, I don't want to have to ask ""Hey, you wanna do it?"" every time because I expect him to be able to initiate and for me to say ""I'm actually not feeling up to it.""

This reads to me as: ""I don't want to initiate, that's his job. Consent is mine."" In practice, consent can be a quick ""you wanna...?"" while reaching for his belt or ""you sure?"" when you get to any new stage of affection. Once you're comfortable with each other a quick ""yeah?"" or an eyebrow raise can suffice. It's not difficult."

field, you can have the following:

    public Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; PositiveValues {
        get {

(It will be readonly, since it doesn't have a set method. So

     Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; someVariable = anInstance.PositiveValues;

 will be valid and

     anInstance.PositiveValues = someVariable;

will throw a compiler error.)

Or if you have some fields

    private int anIntValue;
    private double aDoubleValue;

Without any history or reads - or if was the very first time I was in this spot against a *brand new* player - the story we're trying to tell when we're raising is that we have a strong hand - so in a vacuum, I raise-bet-bet-check every time, folding to a raise on any street.

I don't care to think about frequency so much, just making what I think is the best in that particular hand, and that particular player. 

Switch the positions and I could check-fold the turn, even though I'm probably always betting the flop. All players are going to be more likely to fold out of position, but call a lot while *in*position.

But, again, this particular hypothetical situation doesn't have reads, so it's basically the equivilant of the first hand of a session, so you could flip a coin more or less in deciding whether to play the hand strong, or to try to establish a certain type of image."

jimmy982,AskMen,1389939737.0,"You've yet to challenge a single assertion I've made with anything other than petty, high minded garbage.  I've yet to change the subject, I've maintained that the subject is what we have always been discussing, that of why or why not a female comic may or may not be funny to most men.  The goalposts have not changed, and you have not made an contention towards one of my points that I have ignored because you have yet to dispute one of my actual points.

I do think that a sense of humour is an evolutionary trait and this is demonstrated by the conversation we are having here.  It seems evident to me that men are considered to be more funny than women.  I've told you that the reason I believe this to be true is because it is a trait selected evolutionarily for men when they are not physically attractive.  If a man is not physically attractive he must show some other traits that a female would find attractive, or he will not be able to pass on his genetic material.  Females in our species do not have that problem, they can be not physically attractive and still have males wanting to mate with then because they are still able to pass on their genetics to the next generation by doing so.

It is a generally recognized trait that men are less empathetic than women (let me spell this out for you simply, MEN ARE LESS EMPATHETIC THAN WOMEN, not MEN HAVE NO EMPATHY EVER or, PENISES MEAN THAT EMPATHY DOES NOT EXIST or anything else).  Because this seems to be true, women would have an easier time of relating to the stories of a male comedian, while men may have a harder time of relating to a female comedian.  

As for the rest of it, after you quoted me (which, I'm not sure how to do, so kudos) you've clearly misrepresented everything I've said.  If you cannot even comprehend that the entire sentence that I wrote is where the context lay, instead of the three words that you have chosen to bold from my assertion, then I'm afraid we have nothing further to discuss, as you are clearly a moron.  In fact, the only reason I have decided to respond to you now is in the hopes that you will read this and see how fucking ridiculous your lack of argument is, and promptly fuck yourself kindly."

OohLongJohnson,TrueReddit,1389939836.0,"Many rebel groups have actually turned against ISIS and started actively expelling their forces from cities including Aleppo.

The Free Syrian Army and many of it's other allies (including Al Nusra) are now at war with ISIS throughout Syria. 

http://syrianobserver.com/News/News/Islamic+Front+Expels+AlQaeda+Militants+from+AlBab+Aleppo

http://syrianobserver.com/News/News/Nusra+Officially+Declares+War+Against+ISIS


Also Syria was within ""Iran's sphere of influence"" before this war even began. They were one of Iran's closest allies. We are hoping to pick up a new ally in the Middle East after Syria falls while also trying to strengthen our ties with Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 

I do not believe our position with Iraq is about Iran now though. Our primary concern with Iraq is cleaning up the mess we created to try to make it seem like it was not a huge mistake for us to have gone there in the first place. If we let Iraq fall apart again, it makes us look terrible and the lives, money and political currency we put into it would be for nothing. 

Furthermore in terms of this ""pivot to Asia"" you are referring to, Syria has become a large part of Asian diplomacy. Russia and China are still our greatest world rivals, and it just so happens that they are both allies of Assad (as is Iran). Russia is partly what drew us into having any involvement with Syria to begin with as they were not-so-discreetly giving Assad attack helicopters, rockets and other weaponry. 

Let us also not forget about Israel, our strongest ally in the region. An unstable Syria is dangerous to Israel, and it being a fertile ground for extremist groups makes it a large concern of Israel. Israel wants to have as friendly of a government as possible in Syria when all this violence comes to an end. As this is an interest of theres, it is also an interest of ours. "

duffmanhb,bitcloud,1389939880.0,"Are you familiar with how Tor works? If you don't, basically, Tor helps people use the internet anonymously. How it keeps it anonymous is because unlike standard internet which says, go from point A (my house) to point B (the website), and then back again -- Tor creates a lot of steps in between. 

So instead of A to B, it's A (home) to B (node) to C (node) to D (node) and finally to E (the website). What makes it safe is several things. For starters, the data is encrypted, so the nodes it's passing through don't know what the message is saying. Second, the nodes don't know who the message is from or who it's supposed to go to. All the know is ""I got this message from B, and I have been told to pass it on to D"" and so on...

What makes this anonymous is let's pretend we own the website. We don't actually know where the message is coming from, and we know is node ""D"" handed it off to us. And the only way to send a message back is to give the message back to D, and he'll give it to C, and then to B, and then finally to you. Every person in that chain is blind of who else is involved. 

Not only that, but there are servers that are effectively hidden. Traditionally, when you connect to a server, you do it directly, thus revealing it's location. However, when you are forced to go through this chain, it's impossible for you to actually know where the server is located.

Okay, so now that's squared away, what does this have to do with Bitcloud?

Bitcloud plans to operate much like this but slightly different. See with Tor, no one has an incentive to actually be a ""node"". No one wants to be a node other than for philanthropic reasons. However, everyone wants to use Tor. The problem this creates is a lot of lag. The tubes are all clogged up with people trying to use it, and not enough nodes to spread the traffic around. Think of it like everyone in an apartment building using the same wifi internet, rather than everyone having their own -- many nodes is much faster than just one node. 

Well Bitcloud creates an incentive to actually become a node. Whenever you set up and create a node, all the traffic that goes through it is much like mining for bitcoin. So the more nodes and faster the internet you have, the more coins you can mine. So this gives people an incentive to actually want to contribute to making the network better and faster.

Second, hosting content. So people that are operating nodes are getting cloudcoins generated for them much like bitcoin. But there is yet another way to get cloudcoins, and that's from hosting content on a server. Now, you don't necessarilly know what that content is because it's encrypted, but you offer to have whatever it is hosted and part of the ""cloud"". This too will make you cloudcoins! Why is that? See whenever something is pulled from the ""cloud"" the nodes have to pay the server a very tiny amount of the cloud coins that they've generated. 

So let's say the node generated 1 cloud coin for all the traffic going through it. So that node owner gets a cloud coin. BUT to access the data that is being requested by the user, they have to pay .1 cloud coin. 

The idea is, that everyone wins and it all pays for itself. If you have a popular bitcloud website, that means you'll need a lot of hosting to keep up with the demand and that costs money! But if you have a popular website, that also means you are getting paid a lot of cloudcoin, so that can be used to get more hosting!

But it goes even deeper! Okay, so in this example we have the node making 1 cloud coin, and the host of the content making .1 cloud coin for every time a video is played on his site. Now let's pretend that I am a musician and I have a music video I know a lot of people are going to like. What I can do is go to the site people play videos on and say, ""Hey, you have a lot of people coming here and I have a really good video. I tell you what. Everytime someone plays MY video I want .01 cloudcoin. You get to keep .09 out of the .1 you are being paid for hosting the data and I want to get .01 for letting you use my data"" I don't have to do any work. I just upload the video, and every play, I get .01 cloudcoin!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea behind this is that everyone within this network makes coins. From the nodes, to the hosts, to the content providers. It's a self sustaining business for everyone with no central authority. Simply put, the more people use bitcloud, the more people make money! There is no way to regulate it either since it's all peer 2 peer. It's a great concept but god damn will it be tough.

* Have some kind of restraint. Some good ones are an old, supple leather belt or handcuffs. You can tie her hands above her head, or behind her back if you're doing her from behind.
* If you're out and can tell she's already in the mood, you can sorta ""pre-dominate"" by telling her what she has to do the second you get home. i.e. ""Right when we get home I want you to strip down, get on your knees, and suck on my cock until I tell you to stop."""

They are the most closed off, judgmental, old-fashioned people I've ever met. His father gave him a book for Christmas the year we got engaged. Pulled him aside and said, ""You might need this later. Open it at home."" It was written by the Pope and about sex. The most explanatory it got was ""Women have a secret garden and there's a gate to the garden. If you want to play in the fountain you have to get the key."" So, I guess he did get sex-ed?

I know this isn't on-topic, but his parents are so toxic I really want to move to a different area so that they don't have such a hold on him.

But you're absolutely right. This isn't going to be pretty or easy. We won't separate, because short of abuse I'm never going to leave him. (I'm not Catholic or against divorce. I just love him for better or worse.) I'm going to have to talk to him, and not let him run away when he gets embarrassed."

Ontario Catholic Schools are always on the defensive; their existence is pure special treatment and we ought to move toward either an all-or-nothing system. I'd prefer we have no government funded religious schools and just have a public secular system.

Buscat,gifs,1389940076.0,"Well, sort of. During Christ's lifetime, he was doing what hundreds of other Jews were doing. He was claiming to be the messiah. There were different beliefs about what the Messiah would do, but the broad strokes of it had been laid out in the book of Isaiah. Most people expected the Messiah to lead them out from Roman occupation and restore the kingdom of Israel. This was something that was meant to happen during his lifetime, or so most people thought.

After he was killed, instead of dying out like the followings of other Messiahs, the early Christians shifted their approach. He was still going to do all the stuff a messiah does, but he was going to do it from beyond the grave. Having already been resurrected, he would come to earth again at some point. This was generally believed to be like, about to happen any time. It still is.

They also reinterpreted the meaning of the Messianic prophecy. It wasn't just put in a Jewish light anymore, he was going to create a heavenly kingdom where all are welcome. This sort of thing is what allowed Christianity to become attractive to people throughout the Roman Empire."

If I'm not wet enough, it can feel like ow, ow, ow, that's nice, ow, ow, that's nice, ow. The pain is from the friction against the labia during the in-and-out motion. So I sometimes prefer that a guy leave his penis in for a few seconds at the beginning to let my body adjust. 

Generally, though, a penis in the vagina gives a feeling of fullness, as others have described. It's almost like a sense of relief or comfort, but at the same time, it's intense. It's like sort of like getting a hug on the inside of your body. Or like if you could give your organs a nice warm bath, but like if you step into the bath and go ahh, and then go out and then step in again and feel even more amazing then when you first got in the bath, and then step out again and every time you go in the bath it's like the best bath you've ever had.

This will result in a section of the game in which you're in some kind of limbo. Previously I had imagined that you would somehow escape from this and end up back in whatever dimension you were previously in, but now I think it might be plausible for you to land in Michigan somewhere in the vicinity of Chell. It might also be plausible for Chell to then find you and be kind of a sidekick for the ensuing section of gameplay. I'm not sure how you could then get back to whoever you were with before, or whether or not Chell would come with you (entirely likely), but I would love to see that in the game somewhere, probably as some sort of breather between crazy intense sections."

runningsalami,Games,1389940468.0,"The problem is that the genders are social constructions, not biologically predetermined (except the obvious penis/vagina thing). As such, you limit what you allow characters of a certain gender to do, either because it's ""fitting"" or for a believed economical gain.

I would disagree that most games are genderblind. Let's do an experiment. Google the last years top sellers of games and examine what gender the protagonist is and if you create your own character, what gender and how did they market it?

As a rule of thumb, men are often more resourceful and taking all the decisions in games. Women are mostly simply following a man and not being independent. Often men are single in games, while female characters are put there for eye candy or romance. Not saying this happens all the time, since there are interesting examples of breaking that norm, but still.

Why does fatherhood and motherhood need be so different? It's mostly a superficial trait which isn't that different from each other.

tangerinelion,Physics,1389940794.0,"In undergrad our Quantum II class was interested in having some kind of particle physics course, and despite the small department one of the professors was an experimentalist in that field as a grad student.  We didn't have researchers, so all our professors took their teaching seriously.  So we were able to talk him into offering a ""Quantum III"" course that he more or less made up as we went along.

Some of it was figuring out which decays are allowed and why some are not, following Griffiths book.  Some of it was playing around with the Dirac matrices, all that.  The most involved we got was calculating the decay rate of something like Z to dileptons to get the cross section.  Which, for those of you who have not done this, ends up being a multi-page calculation when you take everything into account. 

By this point every student was eligible to graduate, and a couple of us had also finished the requirements for a math major.  So we could reasonably be exposed to whatever math the professor felt like throwing our way and ended up giving us an oral final, made public to the department with pizza available.

However, my personal experience leads me to believe that, rather than changing anything, having the correct hormones helps to unlock one's true self, and a ""change in orientation"" should be correctly interpreted as a release of repressed feelings. When you can't accept yourself, things tend to get pushed back, and the process of accepting yourself and becoming who you really are leads to things ""changing"" to be how they are supposed to be.

I also gained about 20lbs, even though I exercise heavily and never changed my diet. I've only lost about 5lbs since. Thankfully, I've been underweight my entire life, so physically it wasn't an issue.. but the sudden gain just contributed to an overall sense of no longer feeling like myself after I got the injection.

Never, ever again.

You could be seeing the effects for a while, I'm sorry. I wish you luck. For some people, depo is a blessing. For many others, it was a curse..there are actually lawsuits against it, people trying to have it taken off the market or at least better advertised for its risks.

svaachkuet,racism,1389940927.0,"Then perhaps something you may want to do first is test whether people can actually use voice quality to accurately perceive race. I'm imagining a psycholinguistic task of some kind, like a [matched-guise experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched-guise_test), where a respondent picks the portrait of the most likely speaker of the audio stimulus, with race as an implicit variable. Or it can be something more elaborate. Perhaps this kind of study has already been done, but I am not yet aware of any detailed phonetic analysis of the recorded stimuli in such an experiment. If participants can reliably extract acoustic cues to (apparent?) racial identity (leaving out the question of racial self-identification—what the person him/herself actually identifies as), then perhaps we can say that there's something (or some things) in speech that encodes racial identity. It's certainly true that some manners of speaking index race, e.g. features of [AAVE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English) may be found idiosyncratically in a non-AAVE speaker's speech, thereby causing that speaker to ""sound black"". It's just that in the literature that I've read on psycholinguistic studies that investigate the perception of race, participants don't seem to agree with each other on judgments, even judgments about the race of non-white people when looking at photographic images. The speculation is that the perceivers can have such wildly different experiences with race to the extent that they cannot agree on which features of an individual's voice or appearance can be labeled can be ascribed to a person of a particular (apparent) racial identity. Theoretical inclinations aside, isn't this a substantial practical obstacle for you? If listeners can't agree on how a person of a particular race should speak, how do we figure out what information in speech (in ɡeneral) cues that racial identity? (Asking the listeners directly is a bad idea, as it could evoke stereotypes and not what is actually in the acoustic signal.)

An issue for me is the ""by phone"" part of your question. Some mobile telephone companies still use the traditional audio standard that limits transmitted frequencies to a range of 300 Hz to 3.4kHz. However, vital information in human speech ranges from 80 Hz to as high as 14kHz! Under the traditional standard, a sound like ""f"" (as in ""fin"") sounds identical to the human ear as a sound like ""th"" (as in ""thin"") because the acoustic contrast between these sounds occurs at frequencies above 3.4kHz (the audible contrast is essentially cut off!). That's why it can be difficult to hear someone else's voice over the phone. In a phone conversation, a listener could be getting even less information about the speaker's voice than he/she would if he/she were standing right in front of the listener (with the listener's eyes closed, of course). However, audio standards for telephone communications are improving these days, so who knows…??"

dirfarg,bodybuilding,1389940930.0,"&gt;How is it that I saw great strenth gains doing it 3x a week, when most people it seems would advise against it?

Who? One of the most popular hypertrophy [routines](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=157587143) on bodybuilding.com is full body every day.

&gt;If I were to switch back to the program where I continue doing these movements 3x a week and I continue progressing in strength, would I be sacrificing maximum muscle growth for strength

Not necessarily. You're drawing a false dichotomy between strength and hypertrophy. For a guy who's your height/weight a good program will give you both. Come back when you're a pro bber or powerlifter and my advice will be drastically different.

&gt;Hypertrophy and plenty of rest between chest days for the maximum growth, or sacrificing maximum growth for more strength

Not quite. this is just the typical meathead ideology of ""after i torch my biceps I shouldn't touch them for a week"". Increasing frequency and being smart with volume will actually help build more muscle. There's been a shift recently where most people are recommending 2x/bodypart a week training whereas a few years ago brosplits of 1x/bodypart abounded. Some of the greatest mass building programs coaches use for athletes involve 2x a day training and other really high frequency work. As long as you're smart with it, there shouldn't be a problem."

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389941234.0,"What do you expect? Probably a major portion of the libertarian/ancap community are ex republicans who still hold republican platforms to a degree.

Not to mention, I think this might be a good time to really get to the root of American libertarian thinking.

This whole ""life liberty and property"" stuff comes from John Locke, but was adopted in our constitution. As we know, a lot of republicans/libertarians are obsessed with maintaining 18th century ideals in their limited government stuff.

But where do these right's come from? Well, a good American libertarian would believe that they come from our creator, ie, ""God"". So...in a sense, I think that a lot of the pro life responses are due to implicit religious views held by the adherents.

Either that or it's just the fact that they have an overly broad understanding of the right to life, and considering how black and white they are, it might not be unreasonable to assume they treat ""life"" as an absolute.

Honestly, I became pro choice around the time I became an atheist...without believe in God, or at least overly obtuse views on implementing ""rights"" (which to me doesn't even make sense without a form of divine command theory), there's no reason to be against abortion to the point you wish to deny other people the ability to get one."

If Minzy didn't sound good, then you know 2NE1 had a *bad* performance.  What the heck happened?  

Was Lim Kim lip-syncing?  Because if so...why?  I don't think I've ever watched a lipped performances from her, so that's weird.

Sulli's lack of fucks she's been giving in 2013 and early 2014 really affected their group stages, so this one is their best performances in ages.

There are like five members of EXO who actually have their mics turned on.  And half of those are the rappers.

BTS has the stage presence of a veteran group.  Which makes sense if you know the members, but it's great to see some amazing and put-together stages.

SHINee were the best performers of the night.  I would be more sad they lost the Daesang, if it didn't rely so heavily on sales.  I'm actually glad the Grammys doesn't use this system among all the other issues it has.  Davichi also did really well, so did Hyorin, Ailee + Baechigi, Roy Kim, BTS in terms of performance, and B2ST.

Jericho Season 3: Civil War is a comic book limited series of six issues that continues the storyline of the CBS television show Jericho. It was written by Jason M. Burns and the Jericho writing team.

On March 12, 2009, Devil's Due Publishing announced that all storylines from the TV series will be continued in a comic book series. On November 25, 2009, Devil's Due Publishing released the first issue of the six-issue continuation of the Jericho saga. As of May 29, 2011, IDW Publishing has re-released the first 3 comics as Jericho: Redux, as well as issues 4, 5 and 6, thus completing its publication.

In August 2011 IDW collected all 6 comics into a 144-page graphic novel entitled Jericho Season 3: Civil War."

winnacht,rum,1389941413.0,"**Mount Gay Rum Extra Old**

43% ABV

* **Colour:** Deep Amber
* **Nose:** Buttery sweetness. I assume this is the rum smell? It really smells wonderful. Maybe some hints of bannana and some kind of stone fruit, nectarines maybe?
* **Taste:** Sweet and spicy, very buttery, a rich mouth feel. 
* **Finish:** Warm and rich, more of the stone fruit comes through, fairly long length, as it fades it seems to get sweeter.

I am a rum noob. This is the second bottle that I've bought and really only the second time that I have tasted in earnest. Therefore I can only fallback
on comparing it what else I have drunk. It reminds me of a port finish scotch, kind of like a Quinta Ruban. It is really quite sweet, but not in an overly
sweet way like a bourbon. The sweetness is richer and fuller but definitely there. That mouth feel is amazing, sweet but with spice that tickles the edges
of my tongue.

The only other rum that I have tried is The Kraken which smelled nice, tasted good, but had an artificial finish (tasted like coke zero so maybe Aspartame
or Phenylalanine is added) that I find rather unpleasant. What surprised me most is that the cost to step up from Kraken to this is only about $12 ($53 vs $65)
which is really a no brainer.

Overall I really enjoy this and I can see myself keeping a bottle around. Anybody got some recommendations as to similar bottles? I'm in Australia so availability

Equally, if you can get a job on campus or somewhere that helps you meet lots of people, go for it.

Donald Trump's Trump International near the Time Warner building on Columbus Ave with the big globe.

Not really sure if they don't have floors 4, 14, 24, 34, 44 etc. Might have just been a joke or rumor.

OohLongJohnson,TrueReddit,1389941555.0,"1. We are still MILES ahead of the third world, that is a huge exaggeration.

2. We care because of international politics. Iran, Russia and China namely. We don't care at all about Syria, we care about Assad's allies and who will take over once/if he is ousted. If we want to have any leverage in negotiations with Iran (such as the ongoing nuclear talks) we need to have some kind of presence in the region to make us relevant. 

3. The case could definitely be made that Iraq was a huge waste of money but most of the Iraq spending at least is behind us. To claim that Iraq and Syria (which in the grand scheme of things we've spent negligible amounts on) are the reason that domestic spending is limited is flawed logic. It's not like there is one big pool of money that our government draws out of when it comes to domestic spending vs international spending. The fact of the matter is, congress can more easily appropriate funds to wars and international affairs than they can for domestic spending. Education, infrastructure, healthcare, social welfare etc.. that funding is actively cut while we write blank checks for the military (and NSA, CIA etc... Much of which isn't even on the books). The priorities are fucked up yes, but it's not like cutting our spending on foreign involvement will directly go into domestic programs, it just doesn't work like that. "

But people started posting genuine personal anecdotes about their struggles with judgment, unwanted touching, or jealousy from friends and strangers alike (a lot of swole people are actually quite shy and feel very uncomfortable when people spontaneously grope them, they call it ""swolestation""), and the sub now occupies a dual-purpose space that oscillates between satire and unironic emotional support.

It's a lot cheaper now, and awareness is a lot higher. And a lot of people that got infected in weird ways, like blood transfusions, don't get infected any more because the screening is so rigorous.

If we're talking physically pulling her away, there's a trick to countering that. You pull also and turn it into a light tug of war. Then you make sure that he actually ends up winning, and you dispassionately walk away and game the next girl around.

It's weird, but it tends to work. The guy almost always is going to go too hard. He's gonna come away look like the try hard. So, you want to make enough effort to let her know you're interested but you can do without her, and then let go.

Most of the time, she will try to find you later once she gets bored with the guy who ""won"".

Think of it kind of along the lines of the programming idea of ""failing elegantly"". All you want to do is not get blown completely out, not appear to fold too quickly.

Some other guys will have recommendations about negging the guy by asking if he's ""her boyfriend for tonight"" or some such, but my game's pretty aloof, quiet, and physical, so . . . I'll leave that to those who know better."

This same method can non only be used to deny the chance to start your own business, without public education, it can also be used to prevent people from acquiring marketable skills. Now, I don't buy Marx's position that this will eventually lead to people being sorted into only two groups. There will always be in-between folks, but that doesn't change the fact that it can, and without the right political and social controls, will be used to disenfranchise the majority of the population. As technology continues to advance, the value of a baseline human will continue to depreciate. A person's labor will become even more worthless absent some kind of capital to enhance it, be it education, machinery, and in the future, maybe even bio mechanical augmentation.

You are right though, if minimum wage is an option and the market decides to adhere to that government limit, than so be it, they have decided. 

My comment was more directed at the idea of raising the minimum wage, which would drive up costs and inflate the prices of the product. That wouldn't happen if we allowed the market to just decide what they worker ought to be payed. "

gerusz,AdviceAnimals,1389942135.0,"Then what do you propose the negation is? ""It is not the case that all dragons are blue"".

To disprove a claim, you have to prove the negation. (Well, technically. Since ""All dragons are blue"" is a positive claim, the burden of proof lays on the one making it.) How do you prove that it is not the case that all dragons are blue?

I guess you're thinking about ""dragons don't exist"". True, by proving that dragons don't exist, you disprove the claim that all of them are blue... but still, it's not the negation of the *original* claim.

If the original claim was ""Dragons exist and all of them are blue"" then the negation would be, ""It is not the case that dragons exist and all of them are blue"". Using the DeMorgan identities it is equivalent to saying ""It is not the case that dragons exist or it is not the case that all of them are blue"". In which case disproving either part is sufficient.

Applying it to the original statement ""all popular feminists spaces contain people who abuse feminism"": the transformed statement would be

""popular feminist spaces exist and all popular feminist spaces contain people who abuse feminism"".

Negation: ""It is not the case that yadda-yadda"", DeMorgan, ""It is not the case that popular feminist spaces exist or it is not the case that all popular feminist spaces contain people who abuse feminism"".

""It is not the case that popular feminist spaces exist"", I disprove this statement by showing you Jezebel, of course after determining some conditions for ""popular"", say ""PageRank"" or whatever.

So the only way to disprove it remains disproving the second part.

I was working on the implicit assumption that popular feminist spaces exist. This might be a mistake if we look at the statement tabula rasa, but in the current context we were working within a framework where ""popular feminist spaces exist"" is an accepted fact."

xthorgoldx,Games,1389942194.0,"Christ, ""a lot more complicated"" doesn't even *begin* to describe how nuts that glitch was.

When Cosmo explained it in his 2013 run, it basically consists of the manipulation of four separate glitches:

1. The ""Ocarina Items"" glitch, in which equipping a bottle with a specific item inside overwrites your inventory data values, which can be used to let you ""use"" an ocarina song as an item
2. The Death-Frame glitch, which involves killing a boss the same frame you die in order to get the door open in the first place
3. The Blue Warp glitch, which involves entering the warp dropped by the first boss the *exact instant* you enter a *certain* animation with the aforementioned Ocarina Items glitch in action, which activates an in-game timer that's counting down to a cutscene activation.
4. The Cutscene Cancel glitch, a subset of the above action, which allows you to control Link during the countdown timer from the warp
5. The Unrender glitch, which manipulates the camera angle in such a way that the Blue Warp stops rendering and, with it, the clock stops counting down at a *very specific* number range
6. Blue Warp glitch (revisited), after stopping the countdown it's possible to use the Ocarina Items glitch *again* while doing a 180* spin to re-spawn the Blue Warp, starting the counter...
6. The Cutscene Level glitch, in which you jump through the door in the Deku basement, triggering the game to load a specific level... but because of your data manipulation from the past few glitches, the counter it uses to determine *which* level to load changes. Thanks to a quirk of engineering, the value you can get with the Blue Warp glitch from the Deku basement will warp you to the Ganon bossfight, at which point the game ""remembers"" that it has a cutscene to render... and the cutscene that's supposed to play in the point you're at is the one that plays after Link kills Ganon the first time, so it plays that scene and the game rolls from there.

It took him longer to describe the mechanics around this exploit than it did for him to summarize the history of OoT speedrunning from 2006 to 2012."

Many of the rebel groups are now calling themselves secular, but there is no way a truly secular government could end up in charge of Syria. 

I wouldn't be surprised if Syria ends up being divided after all of this but I guess we will have to wait and see. I agree that there is a good chance of a hostile government taking over but it's hard to know how well the rebels are doing and what they would want/would be able to do if they ""won"". It's clear that they don't all agree on their ideal future for Syria and it's also interesting that some claim they aren't looking for power once the war is over. Not to mention the significant percentage of non-Syrians taking part in the war. I simply do not know enough to make a good guess at what will become of Syria and sadly I do not see it ending any time soon. 

The one thing we can all agree on is this is an unimaginable tragedy, and if anyone hasn't seen it, there is an absolutely heartbreaking image near the top of /r/pics of a young Syrian child sleeping between the makeshift graves of his parents. It really humanized the conflict.

EDIT - in terms of taking a side on Syria I agree that it could come back to hurt the US. While I think Russia, China and Iran's involvement forced us to choose a side, we also needed to show some support for Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey has had several incidents with its border and even had some casualties on their land since the war started. Once they sided with the rebels we had more pressure to join them to show our support if they were forced further into the conflict. "

So, if you hold both the empire and the kingdom, and your counties form a complete duchy, you have to give away the kingdom, transfer the counties to that king, wait for the duchy to absorb into the kingdom, then revoke the kingdom, and you'll have what you want.

Let charming Martin Yan show you how to bone a chicken in 19.5 seconds, especially the part about boneless wings at the end: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVHO1JY4Vc8

Whole carcases are cheaper than [the sum of the] parts where I'm from, and I regularly do a roast-chicken ""cycle"". Roast chicken the first night of course, usually with friends because the presentation is visually appealing, and it's an excuse to overproduce several side dishes so that I have leftovers to lunch on for a few days. Then all kinds of chicken dishes, eaten when prepared or portioned out and boxed up in saved plastic Chinese takeout boxes and frozen as complete meals I can just toss in the microwave and hit Auto Sensor Reheat. Finally finishing off with an incredible chicken soup (dumplings optional) made from the carefully saved bones and cartilage from sometimes more than one carcase - nothing goes to waste including skin, rendered fat, giblets.

Two Life Pro Tips about bones: (1) They are made from collagen and bone. Simmer them to kingdom come until they crush between your fingertips and you will have leached all the collagen out. The collagen makes the broth thick without cornstarch or flour. (2) On Roast Night, season the *cavity* of the carcase. It will season the whole chicken, but after the skeleton is picked clean, when you boil the skeleton you will already have those residual spices inside that will flavor the broth you make from them.

If you want a few ridiculously simple personal recipes for bone-in chicken I'll post them if you ask."

Either way the problem I see with bitcoin and dogecoin is that they are both deflationary. I think fortunately that the fact that dogecoin has 10 billion coins helps it a lot more than bitcoins 21 million or whatever.

Any deflationary ""currency"" will lead to hording. This is one of the reasons why economists like the USD to have a small but consistent inflation to encourage consumption.

Unless one of the crypto-currencies fixes this problem I don't see wide spread use as a currency. I think the huge amount of dogecoins helps it to seem more inflationary right now but eventually people will start to hoard dogecoins when they become more and more difficult to mine and  when we get closer to the end of the distribution of them."

MarkWW,musictheory,1389942840.0,"There's a D playing under the F#min7, which could then be interpreted as a D9.

The G feels like the tonic to me. You could then interpret the song as:

III, V, I, VII, V, I

The melody does seem to center around D, to the point of going to C# when the chord progression hits F, feeling very much like a major 7th to D and resolving up to D, but since so much of the chord progression spends time dancing around D this isn't unusual.

You can flip the V I progression to a I IV progression in which case the chords can be read as follows - the VI and III being substitutes for I.

VI, I, IV, III, I, IV

But the G feels like the I to me.

The thought process was probably something like ""I have a V, I progression, but that's boring, how do I dress it up? I can make a Dmaj7, that's nice, I can put a B below that, but now it sounds too minor, so let me make it a full on B major and keep the C# from the Dmaj7 chord making it an add 9. I can make the G chord a major 7, which keeps the F# from the D.

Ok now how do I mess around with it the second time, well I went down to B major, so next I can go up to F#, and again keeping with the tone of the song let's make it a major chord. This keeps the F# and the C# from the first Badd9. Now to mix it up some more, I can keep the F on the right hand, but drop to a D in the bass, but that's too minor sounding, so we'll make the F an Fminor7, which will build a D9."""

xthorgoldx,rage,1389942985.0,"*Actually* fun trivia time! Circumcision in the US comes less from a religious background than you'd think; it's almost entirely a social norm born of a government policy from WW1 to WW2 or so.

During the war and interwar era, the US military mandated that soldiers and sailors be circumcised as a preventative measure against venereal diseases (One word: Syphilis). A good number of men were put through the procedure and, after coming home from the war, became fathers.

Now, let's be honest here. Kids see their dad's dick on occasion. And what dad wants to explain to his kid why he's different down in the manly bits than daddy is? Additionally, there was talk at the time of making circumcision mandatory for *all* boys in the US. Whether for cosmetic/social norm reasons or for preventative reasons (if not now, then later, and then he'll remember it), a lot of a dads started getting their kids circumcised. 

By WW2 circumcision rates were at 50%, and they only continued to climb as it became the norm, into the present day.

On a related note, the reason San Francisco is a hub of homosexual culture is because homosexual soldiers were discharged there during WW2 and left to their own measures. San Francisco has a huge gay population as a side effect of DoD administration practices.

A lot of guys buy into to hardcore side of the spectrum not realizing that just like alpha (stupid term what was wrong with nietzce's uberman) and beta are a spectrum to judge men. Women too come in a wide variety of flavors. Behavior traits are not absolute no matter how closely they correlate. Trends however are an entirely different animal. The guys that buy into it hardcore are mgtow crowd. I personally love women for their good traits and bad. 

As for doing research into the science behind it there is the fear of being associated with trp and also backlash from the extremists on the feminist side. Human sexuality is a tough ever changing dynamic though so hold on for the ride? 

Edit: as for dark triad traits. They have their purposes but being that all the time is exhausting never mind like you said everyone hates you.

1kachan,Conservative,1389943225.0,"Unfortunately there was a time where I was a member of the leftmost mainstream political party in Canada (huge mistake, but it helped lead me to my current position so I guess it was worth it) and their argument was that minimum wage ought to be fixed to just above the poverty line so that workers are ""pulled out of poverty"" and can live with ""dignity"" not having to worry about making ends meet. 

The argument usually doesn't take into consideration the implications of raising minimum wage such as increased labour costs on the employer which can be dealt with in a number of ways, whether that be through government subsidies, inflation of prices, or downsizing (or all three in some cases). 

What I am surprised at is that minimum wage is the thing the left turns to when it comes time to discussing combating poverty. There is another wage policy known as Guaranteed Minimum Income (which is a welfare policy payed for through increased taxation) which in theory, doesn't contribute to inflation on the same scale as minimum wage, and doesn't mettle into the affairs of the free-market. I am in no means endorsing this policy, just discussing it. "

* View: What the user sees
* Controller: Main logic of your website, binds and manipulates Models and places them in the View

So I said, as politely as I could, ""I'm very sorry, but I come in for you folks and then I get in trouble for working more than my allotted hours. I'm sorry, but I cannot do it."" 

My manager retorts with this: ""Well! It's *OBVIOUS* you don't know what responsibility is!!"" And she proceeds to slam the phone down. I was livid.

I ended up getting fired for telling the deli manager to ""...get the goddamned stick out of her ass!"" in front of customers. I never thought I'd actually be relieved to be fired from a place.  "

OohLongJohnson,TrueReddit,1389943527.0,"It's not about being ""cold"" and meeting criticism. Our government give zero fucks about those things. We send far more weapons and war technology than food and medicine to Syria. It's all about politics. While it may not seem important, it's about playing the right moves to advance our position in the world, not just the Middle East.  Isolationism seems great in theory but the world is far too globalized currently for the US to simply withdraw from foreign affairs. 

International politics is like playing an enormous and tediously long game of chess, with unimaginably high stakes. Advancing a pawn one space doesn't seem like a big deal but it is all part of a bigger plan. If you just sit back and pass on your turns, you will look up 20 turns later and find yourself with unfavorable surroundings and no way to change them.

EDIT - the unfavorable outcomes I'm referring to could manifest themselves in real life in the form of - more nuclear powers in the Middle East. Loss of power and influence for Israel, Turkey and Saudi Arabia and thus huge losses of international power for the US and a far more anti-western, Middle East. Diplomatic and economic gains for China and Russia at our expense etc.. You can't just sit back and expect to remain a superpower. I'm not saying that we don't make a lot of stupid mistakes with our international policy, but it is absolutely essential to our well being as a country and to our future prosperity that we maintain a strong international presence,

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389943547.0,"&gt;Feminism can be defined in a number of ways, and it isn't monolithic in any of them.

What you mean is that there are many divisions within feminism, however the core concepts of feminism are shared. Women are at a disadvantage in society by many means and feminism seeks to shed light on these inequalities while also seeking ways to alleviate them. These inequalities endow men with gender privilege and are the result of a phenomenon known as patriarchy, a cultural framework designed to give men control over women for reproductive purposes. Feminism has found this system of oppression is completely unnecessary for human survival and seeks equality amongst gender.

While many feminists disagree on where forth we go from here in philosophy, among the many dug trenches in the movement, the general concepts above are the ones which drive the movement in seeking an end to gender disparity and patriarchal systems of oppression."

I would fairly regularly have depressive episodes and would have to find time to hide myself away for 10 or 15 minutes just to get my head back on straight. Usually I locked myself in the bathroom when I needed this sort of constitutional, but once, I just went into the back room and sat for a bit with my head in my hands. A coworker came back to get some supplies, saw me sitting there, and spat out, ""Must be *nice!* Getting to just sit there while we're all working!"" I gathered myself as best I could and went back out front, but 20 years later, that vitriolic reaction to my attempt to just fucking *exist* still echoes through my head.

1kachan,Libertarian,1389943786.0,"Personally my views toward it are pragmatic. We treat Universal Health Care as if it was a constitutional right; we've had it since 1966 (in certain provinces) and then it was adopted as federal in the 1980s. 

I am from a lower-income household and have benefited from UHC, however dental care in my province is privatized. It is also worth noting that general practitioners are also privatized to a degree, as well as a number of other HC services including physical therapy, and pharma so we don't truly have UHC we have a two-tier system which leans more toward UHC. What is covered in Canada for what we is considered universal is single-payer. 

Ultimately I feel Universal Health Care at this point is as Canadian as the Second Amendment in the United States, so we might as well make sure the system is functions to its best to a reasonable degree by allocating a large enough percentage of our budget, while focusing on balanced budgets and the standardization of care. With that being said, I do think the private sector can play a larger role in HC, how large is up for debate. 

tl;dr I feel UHC in Canada is here to stay, so we might as well make it worth the money. "

In both cases, I would say a repeal of prohibition should come with clemency on the sole charge of possession/selling.  If the sellers are indeed unsavory characters then they will also have violent crimes, robbery, gun violations, etc., which will keep them in prison.  If, however, they're a dumb kid who got caught trying to make some money I don't see why you should keep that guy imprisoned.

Especially on the sole charge of possession.  These people almost certainly can gain employment and pay tax without getting reincarcerated.  Beats spending $50k/yr on housing them.

Lastly, we're not making any of the harder drugs legal.  It would affect only the marijuana charge.  Unsavory characters that one may think ought to be in prison regardless may also have charges related to coke, crack, heroin, etc.  Those still stick and hold them in prison."

hexagram,short,1389944109.0,"I'm sure you could, but for different reasons.

I don't think it's a leap to think that social skills can be aided by your looks, one way or the other. Either because people who look good in some way are more likely to be treated better and given more social opportunity/capital (like just being able to talk to more people with less effort, maybe get away with jokes easier, being approached themselves, I don't know what all it would entail exactly), which just adds up to slightly more practice and slightly less failure. People with less desirable traits would have to work harder on being social proof - work harder to keep people engaged, make them laugh, etc. than someone who has the advantage of being captivating by looks alone, which is just born out of necessity. And empathy is a necessary part of socialization so that's how that follows imo.

I think shortness and tallness fall into these categories to an extent, though not exclusively nor entirely. And while it doesn't affect everyone the same - there's dicks, loners, etc in every group - I don't think it's necessarily a leap to think that people who stand out from the norm are likely to have better social skills out of the aforementioned opportunity/necessity than more average folks.

a55bandit,AskMen,1389944363.0,"Seems like a large number of the population experiences this, males and females. Fappers remorse.

Try not watching porn. Practice some edging instead.

If you are watching porn, just accept that's it's okay, and most normal people do the same thing. It doesn't mean you're some deprived pervert (well...that depends on what you're watching). If fapping too much is causing other mental health problems (anxiety, low self esteem etc), you might want to stop using porn and/or cut back.

I think it's related to a deeply seeded sense of shame, because ""porn is for losers"" and ""winners only hump super models"" and all that stuff. Like ""I'm a loser for fapping here when I *should* be out banging hot chicks."" Society still isn't all that positive on porn, even though it's such a popular thing. Humans are weird creatures.

For instance, Flood Zone usually turns into a rape if one team manages to hold the high roofs, have air dominance with helis, and hold B flag which denies enemy commander the cruise missile.

But make the map infantry only (no vehicles at all), and suddenly it's a fastpaced close quarters combat map, where you don't need to worry about snipers from above.

There's also misattribution of feelings. The experiment that comes to mind is one where they got straight men to cross a rickety rope bridge or something, and then at the other side they were asked some questions either by a reasonably attractive woman or a man. The ones being questioned by the woman all thought they really, really fancied her, but what was actually happening was the stress response (adrenaline etc) from doing the dangerous thing was still active and they misread the feeling of arousal as sexual rather than due to fear.

When I tell people about some of the stuff that's happened to me, I get the fear-adrenaline from retelling the story, and the combination of fear and adrenaline and someone right there that's probably wanting to comfort me (because generic empathy, not because they necessarily want to love me) is the perfect storm for me to suddenly get an obsessive crush and\or just overly clingy on whoever my unfortunate victim is.

Whether Christ Christie would be perceived as a socialist or hard core right-winger hinges in Estonia upon the electorate's understanding of conservative political philosophy and the positions taken by the political parties. Political Parties are not concrete, like political philosophy, and therefore, a spectrum can be skewed, however it doesn't change whether or not Chris Christie himself is a conservative; his policy positions in association to political conservative political philosophy does.

Reminds me of the Toronto game where Kobe had those sick threes. People remember Kobe's offense but Dwight's D was equally as dominant and important.

That said, I can definitely understand why Shaq and Charles think he's not a great player since they have different standards. Watching him in 2009 get absolutely shat on by Pau has always had me convinced he's not someone you build a championship team around (which is why LA I thought was a good fit, since you have Kobe).

Neopopulas,dayz,1389944917.0,"Kinda, yeah? If i engage with someone, if i try and rob them, instead of kill them.. they are just going to log out and make the whole thing pointless.

The risk involved in robbing someone is astronomical compared to just shooting them from the bushes and taking their stuff. Once all the ruined gear actually matters and being ruined is a problem, it might change. But until then, why should i put all the risk on myself, and risk being killed, when they are just likely to log out the second they are at the disadvantage.

Combat logging is a problem in general, and its a problem in a LOT of ways. For example, last night i was in some bushes on the side of a hill with friends, someone sniped one of our team from a pile of rocks along the hill. I advanced, and took a couple of shots. I hit him, i saw blood, he ducks behind the rocks and i carefully advance. I get around the corner and he's gone. Just gone. Nowhere he could have run that i wouldn't see.

HE shot at (and killed) US, and then when he's fired on in return HE is the one to combat log? What the hell man? The cowardice of that boggles my mind."

The US and our allies are totally ok with it, because guess what? We make and enforce the rules. That's like saying we don't believe in assassinations.

The only thing I can think of that we uphold in the Geneva conventions is the use of glass bullets and that's probably because they're impractical - we've used hollow points in war and that's pretty damn close. Also napalm. We bombed civilians in non-combat zones. We definitely violated lots of statutes about prisoners with Guantanamo bay and Abu Ghraib.

noname725,depression,1389945163.0,"Sometimes, yes. I never think that way about other people with depression (and/or other mental illnesses), but sometimes I use that as a way to sort of invalidate myself. Sometimes I tell myself that I have it better than a lot of other people on earth, therefore I shouldn't complain. Sometimes I feel guilty for feeling so terrible when other people have worse situations than I do. Ultimately, though, other people's experiences really have no bearing on our own, and the fact that someone else's life is worse doesn't discount your own struggles. Finally and most importantly, depression (and mental illness in general) is very real. It's not something to feel guilty about. It's not something you can control. 

I think that our guilt arises from living in a society that doesn't understand mental illness (and a society that is even quite negative/nasty toward mental illness at times). Lots of people are constantly trying to discount depression, saying that it's ""all in your head"" or coming up with ideas to ""fix"" depression, which basically boil down to saying ""snap out of it"" or whatever. The general public does not really understand mental illness. They think that because they can't see it, it must not be real. If they haven't experienced it, it's hard for them to grasp the gravity of it sometimes, I think.

In the end, you have nothing to feel guilty about. We all have our own struggles. Mental illness isn't a ""first world problem,"" and it affects people across the globe (and across race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, etc.). It's not your fault."

I know my makeup skills suck but I'm speaking for those girls that are actually good but get buried.

popvt,TheBluePill,1389945250.0,"The girl and I were close friends before I had feelings for her. When I asked her out, she said no at first, then I was kinda down for quite a while. We were still close friends, but we didn't talk much in real life after that, she sort of avoided me.

After a while, she said she started to like me, but she wasn't really sure about it and she absolutely didn't want to be in a relationship anyway. 

The thing is, we both have a mutual friend who's quite arrogant and also quite a bit of a liar. After I asked her, she started talking to him quite a lot (or maybe I didn't realize it until then), but she did not talk to me much in real life, we chatted online and called each other quite frequently though.

I was convinced she liked him, and I asked her about it. She said no, and I believed her. After she said she liked me, she still avoided me in real life, although not as much as before, because she was shy and didn't want anyone to know she liked me.She kept telling me she didn't like him, and even insulted him quite badly, not to his face or anything.

Anyway, that was a few weeks back and it's over now, but I still think she liked him but was ashamed about it, so she never admitted it. My friend acts like a redpiller slightly which is where the trp stuff comes in. I somehow think that the fact that he was like that made her attracted to him or something as opposed to me, I'm quite a shy ""nice guy"" in her words.

tangerinelion,Catan,1389945295.0,"As far as strategy goes, I think I'd rather let you figure it out but if you read the rules (particularly on longest road) you'll get a good idea of certain ways to get points and take points away from other players.

However, trading.  Remember that you can trade with other players during your turn and their turn only.  More importantly, you may think it's really cool to have 9 cards in your hand and 5 are sheep.  This is not cool; you should take the opportunity to trade your sheep for anything else you could use.  Even if you trade 4-to-1 with the bank.  Even if you have a wood and 4 sheep, it may be worth it to trade the sheep for a brick and build a road.  Yes, you'll have no cards afterwards, but if brick is hard to come by this is a good way to get it.

Also, you really need to think about initial placement.  Particularly about whether you want to place a settlement on the coast, and have 2 resources connected to it, or if you want to place on the interior and have 3 resources attached (ignoring hexes which touch the desert).  The advantage of being on a port is sort of offset by the reduced number of resource cards, so I've generally found it harder to win by placing on the coast to start.  But I've also won doing that, so by all means try it out.  (I wouldn't place both on the coast, but certain games may be tempting to try it.)"

Even though people have their limits, I'd like to think that true friends wouldn't drop us just because we open up a lot. I'd like to think that they'd talk to us about it before dropping us. I also think that a lot of us are probably just extra hard on ourselves...like, we probably see ourselves as way more ""annoying"" than we actually are. We probably see ourselves as bigger burdens than we actually are. The people in our lives have lots of reasons to like us, and I'd like to think that they don't have a problem helping us out every once in a while.

Still, if you need to vent frequently and don't want to wear people out, I'd suggest maybe confiding in the internet more. Post here, create a blog or a tumblr for your thoughts, find anonymous chats, etc. It's not quite the same as confiding in friends, but it can really help."

American presidents routinely talk about how we're the global leader in human rights and justice and standing up against atrocities and blah blah blah; do you think that message only plays with dicks? It plays with most of us because most of us have a favorable view of our country, which is to be expected. But that favorable view tends to blind us to looking at facts of our past. We are not blind to the ugly facts of other countries. So we end up thinking that we weren't as nasty as the Japanese, or the ~~Dutch~~ (fuck meant Belgians, was thinking of Congo, fuckfuck), or the Soviets because we haven't ever really looked at the scale of our own atrocities. 

American exceptionalism is a much larger issue than just having dickish people around. It's a part of the nationalist tendency of our culture. Cultures pretty much always have nationalism and nationalism is shitty and really helps get wars started and people hating one another. It ought to be combated.

There is a big difference between the game being ""hard"" and about survival, and the game being a boring slog where you have to 'earn' your fun somehow. Putting all the spawns miles and miles away from where people want to be is just frustrating and annoying and everyone just bee-lines there anyway.

They need to spread out the things people want so that people have to spread out and travel to get it, its hard, its survivalist, its not boring and its still interesting.

I'm going to laugh so hard when all the people around here hanging out for vehicles finally get them. Are they suddenly going to start complaining about how easy vehicles make it? After all, suddenly a long footslog through the countryside turns into a nice roadtrip. Sure its hard to get a car but once you get it.. bam.. easymode right?

mundabit,TwoXSex,1389945534.0,"If you are going to use an enema as part of your preparation, it should been done a few hours before you start having sex, Enema's can irritate the bowel and can make sex uncomfortable, over time, frequent use of enema's can also weaken the bowel, cause you to lose muscle control and destroy the natural flora that keeps your digestive system functional, so if anal is going to become a regular thing, you might want to try other methods of feeling cleaner such as diet changes. 

If a few minutes before sex you are still very nervous or feel unclean, you can use an anal douche, which is similar to an enema, but uses only 10-20ml of liquid inserted only past the first sphincter. 

As for general anal advice, Its great to hear you already use toys and enjoy anal play, its very important to spend lots of time on foreplay when it comes to anal, work your way up just like you would when using toys, If he is comfortable with it use your toys with him. Use finger-play with multiple fingers to slowly work up to a size similar to his penis, take things very very slow and don't be afraid to say ""that's enough for tonight, we can start again another day and maybe get further"" because as aroused as you are, and as long as you try, sometimes your body just isn't in the mood for anal."

My school could not have been more different; the school district was not particularly well-off. It was a public school system, but it was in a suburban area with very few minorities. Strangely, though, they took the time and effort to seek out talented kids and test them for the gifted program. I was a poor immigrant, and the only one in my family who spoke English. One of my teachers noticed that I wasn't being challenged enough in her class and asked that I be given an IQ test. When I scored well above average, they moved me up from 3rd grade math to 5th grade math (while I was in 4th grade).

noname725,depression,1389945729.0,"I think I get what you mean. I don't actually want cancer and I hesitate to say that I would want a serious illness like that because I don't want to disrespect anyone who is actually suffering from a serious illness like cancer, but at the same time, I do sometimes wish that I had something different ""wrong"" with me. I think that at least part of the reason why we feel like this is due to some attitudes in society.

Society and the general public at large are such that they don't really understand things like mental illness. There is a lot of ignorance out there, and even though things in the history of psychology/psychiatry have vastly improved even in just the last few decades, some lingering negative attitudes about mental illness and sufferers still exist. People are constantly looking for ways to discount mental illness. ""It's all in your head,"" ""just be happy,"" ""just snap out of it,"" ""someone else has it worse than you,"" etc. We hear that crap all the time. Sometimes people aren't trying to be malicious, but it still doesn't help. I think that a lot of us internalize these attitudes after hearing them so much. We start to feel like it's not legitimate enough. We start to worry that maybe it doesn't matter as much because you can't really see what's wrong with us (like you can with some physical illnesses). 

In the end, though, mental illness is just as important and can be just as devastating. There also is really no reason to quantify it. If you're suffering, you're suffering -- it doesn't matter if it's your mind or some other organ or part of your body. It all matters. 

Still, I get how you feel, I think. Sometimes when I'm going through a particularly rough or dark patch, I sometimes wish I had something different wrong with me because I feel so alone. Maybe if I had something different wrong with me, more people would understand and care. Sometimes I just really wish that people cared and it often feels like they don't, so that's why I sometimes wish I had something different wrong with me...something more socially understood or socially acceptable. It's hard to shake those feelings sometimes. "

finalDraft_v012,femalefashionadvice,1389945819.0,"YES!!  I don't understand who Free People's ideal customer looks like.  I hear a lot of people tell me, including sales people, that their stuff should look great on your typical skinny girl.  Maybe you have to be skinny and tall, I don't know, but I kind of doubt that.  I'm petite and tried on an armload of stuff from their store; things that should only work on someone thin (because on a bigger person they'd probably look pregnant) are simply overwhelming.  While excess fabric can be a style if draped properly, these things unfortunately were not.  The clothes were eating me up, and I looked like a 6 year old wearing mommy's outfits.  Some of the dresses are borderline costumey (I recall a bright red A-line dress with crazy, overly Mexican even for Mexicans patterns on it).

I got just one great dress from there.  Just a simple black one with some lace detailing on the bottom.  I don't think it's worth more than $30, and luckily I got it on sale (for a little over $30...) but retail price...and the price you pay for it if you order online right now...is like $80.  Not to mention the shoulder strap occasionally unhooks on its own.  I don't get it, their quality is shocking for the price."
LeoKhenir,battlefield3,1389945820.0,"In that case, every vehicle has other vehicles they are strong against, and vehicles they are weak against. On any map will any squad who dedicates itself to the task be able to take down any vehicle. You don't even need the vehicle that's strong against the bothersome vehicle. Three engi's with necessary launchers, one support for ammo and one assault for health, and you'll take down any vehicle.

In 1v1 with different vehicles, the one with the first attack will most often have the advantage (of course within reason - a jeep won't take out an MBT). 

Edit: somehow I didn't complete the post.

Again, vehicles have advantages over some vehicles and disadvantages against others. 

A scout heli isn't supposed to take out IFV's or MBT's, from the air, that's supposed to be Attack Helis or Attack Jets.

IFV's are a crossover between tanks and transports. They are superior against light armored targets and infantry, but aren't supposed to kill an MBT unless they get the jump on it and can drool away two TOWs before the tank can react.

Attack jets like the A10 are close air support for ground forces. They are dedicated as air-to-ground attackers, and as such they can completely rape any vehicle with their guns. Their nemesis is however the stealth jet and the MAA, which is the vehicles any team should use to create and maintain air superiority.

Mobile AA is supposed to rape air vehicles to death. It is the duty of ground forces to take down enemy MAA to help creating air superiority for one's own team."

She was fine when I left, but I was later told by a mutual friend/coworker that she'd spent several minutes crying in the bathroom. I didn't realize what I'd said had been that negative; I duly apologized later, and things got smoothed over.

These kinds of topics aren't always easy to talk about and some people here might not have many people to talk to anyway, so this provides a good space for them. They don't need to discuss the good things in their lives (though they certainly can and do - I've seen plenty of positive topics here before) because they aren't as stressful or as difficult, so you mostly get the bad on here because that's what needs to be worked through.

I don't disagree that ruminating doesn't really help and I don't disagree that some people are probably just throwing pity parties for themselves, but I also think that having an outlet such as this one (anonymous, filled with like-minded people, easy to use, etc.) can be useful as well. "

The paradigm he's looking at is one of running around and looking for jobs. It implies he can't create his own job, which is the general way people look at jobs. If there is a flat limited supply of jobs, then it's a completely valid way to say it may be a while before a job is found. Jobs in that sort of economy are not infinite, no matter what pay you're willing to accept or what job you're willing to do.

But if he were a person to create his own job, or to look at the mediocre pile of jobs available and figure out how to fight their way to the front of the pack of animals, or apply at a temp service, or go to college to increase the number of jobs that might be available... well that's a reasonable way to increase job prospects.

There is much which depends on life circumstances, how one was raised, how well they were supported and understood growing up, etc.  And truth be told there are some folks who are way more affected than myself and it has a more significant impact on their life than my own.  For me, it was more or less a *""Well fuck, that finally makes sense...""* moment after receiving diagnosis because I didn't neatly fit the profile of any of the other diagnosis labels which had been tossed at me over the years.  It simply gave me a protocol for finally understanding my own wiring and being more effective at working on my weaknesses while playing to my strengths.

I'm incredibly high-functioning and often surprise people when I tell them I am on the spectrum but I also owe that to the fact that I was forced to be highly independent and adapt quick or die in the fire, so to speak.  I also don't advocate forcing adaptation either as that comes with a particularly prickly and tough set of problems and I've got damage from it... almost didn't make it this far.  

There is also a lot of idiocy, badly done studies and downright quackery which goes on in the world of Autism Spectrum Disorders and there is still a lot to learn about how to help those with it understand themselves better while adapting to whatever situation they are in as well as possible while still respecting their right to individuality and not trying to force them to pour too much energy into being something they are not, because that robs them of the energy they need to develop themselves in other areas."

Your presence alone helps vouch to fact that he's not a total creep.

As a wing-woman your job is to keep a fun conversation going/help avoid awkward silences (""we were having this argument... what you think""), set him up for jokes, bring up funny stories that he can tell, or tell a few stories that paint him a good light (but don't overdo it), make him laugh and feel relaxed so that he can be top of his game.

That drops his TS% by **4.5%**! He goes from 60.3% on the season to 55.8%. Considering he's an average playmaker (ATR = 1.37) and an awful defender, is he even considered an elite player scoring 22 points on 56% TS%? Probably not."

myfriendscantknow,TheBluePill,1389946465.0,"The most compelling thing about TRP, I think, is that it offers a mental block to use against the hurt that comes from rejection. Learning to deal with rejection is a very important life skill, but TRP is the unhealthiest way I've ever seen to get there, and I don't even think you really even do get there.

They have a few nuggets of truth regarding ""approach anxiety"". You gotta just make rejection a ""no big deal"" type of thing in your head, and lose your fear of talking to women. It was tough for me too, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you get shot down, just brush that dirt off your shoulder and move on.

Another common wisdom TRP bumbles with is what they call ""oneitis"" but us sane people just call infatuation. Don't set your sights on one woman you know and build her up in your head until she's on a pedestal. Sure, ask her out if you like her, but don't expect anything and don't worry about getting shot down, there's plenty of other women out there.

So yeah, red pill has the occasional nugget of good advice you could get anywhere else, but it's buried under a mountain of bitterness, sexism, pseudoscience, and much more straight up bad advice. So be cautious.

ejchristian86,knitting,1389946540.0,"Many decent LYSes will have a swift and ball winder available for customer use, and some will even wind it for you.

Speaking as a dyer, I sell my yarn in hanks because it shows off the colors and fibers better than being wound in a ball (I don't have the equipment to wind fancy balls like the big companies that display the yarn well). It gives the customer a better idea of what they're getting and WHY they're paying $20+ for a hank of my yarn when they could just go to Michaels and get a ball for $4. Of course a few of my customers have requested wound balls because they don't have the equipment to wind it themselves, and I'm always happy to accommodate them.

As others have said, you can get a swift and ball winder to make it easier for you. Before I had mine, I used to just put the hank over the back of a spinning chair (most fit just fine) and wound it off of there. It's easier than holding the hank with your feet (or making a friend hold it) because the chair spins just like a swift does."

That's huge. Just sayin'.. Aim for a 1m box (what's that, about 40""). If you're able to jump onto that from standstill, you're already in the top x% for horizontal jumps.

I'm an old, old man, and I can 'manage' a 100 cm box barefoot, but I come from a family with really shitty genetics when it comes to knees, so..

A word of caution: if you're going to incorporate 'jump-offs' in your workout (negative load), try NOT to land with an outstretched foot, and have your achilles/calf take the brunt, but rather flat-footed while using the leg as your dampener. Might feel unnatural, but your tendons will thank you :-)

A smart person would know better than to simply accept what people consider to be taboo without questioning why it's a taboo in the first place. We live in a world where potatoes are eaten regularly. Poisonous potatoes aren't a concern for us because we know better. It's completely stupid to think that eating a potato makes you evil.

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1389947045.0,"Ahh, I use OKCupid also (this is [my own profile](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/nonsequitur1979)) and it has worked better for me than all the other dating/meeting sites.  As far as interests and whatever, I suffer from the same fickleness though my one special interest which was and always has been my first love is gardening/plants, which has a metric fuckload of related special interests like Permaculture, Organic Gardening, Landscaping, Hugelkultur (which I rely on heavily), Traditional Gardening (as well as a million other styles), Botany, Mycology, Biology, etc. so that gave me a pretty firm base to jump from.  I know it's hard but some of those interests you list sound pretty cool and kung fu/martial arts is a good one to stay involved with if you can power through whatever malaise you may be feeling about it.  Sometimes it's just a matter of laying low, understanding that the feeling of disillusionment may pass and watching until the right friends and/or partner(s) come along.  I don't feel a strong drive to be social myself but I do have a small core of friends whom I'm tight with.  I also don't date much these days but when someone comes along who rouses my interest and whom I'm compatible with, I break out of my mold and accommodate.   Really, how to go about it is a deeply personal decision and I won't pretend to speak for you or know for sure what is best, you'd be better at that than me or anyone else."

I was tired of the scars and I wanted to be able to wear short sleeves again. I convinced myself to stop...and for me it was because the cons were outweighing the pros. It worked for a while, but obviously I relapsed.

Now I can go long periods without cutting. I guess I just try really hard to practice self-control. I don't give in to every urge I have. In fact, I only give in a few times per year anymore. I feel like I have it under control, or at least it is as controlled as a self-destructive behavior can be. By not giving in to every urge, I show myself that I can stop and that I don't ""need"" it.

regular-winner,AskMen,1389947143.0,"For the most part, ""Cool.""

I occasionally play games with two women; my sister and a female friend of mine. It's usually something like Minecraft, Terraria, or Starbound. Outside of those two, my experience gaming with women is almost 100% World of Warcraft. There, it didn't really matter to me if they were a female gamer, just like it wouldn't matter if the checker at my grocery store is male or female. The only time it actually raises an eyebrow is when it's in highly competitive games like FPSs and MOBAs, as those genres are *extremely* male dominated in my experience; it's a note of curiousity, not disapproval.

In my experience, both men and women can play the obnoxious, attention whore, or drama llama cards in guilds/social groups equally well. I do think that *some* women that are into the genres that are more heavily male-skewed tend to attention-seek more aggressively, or otherwise be able to maturely handle the attention they get; but more frequently, I see women *hiding* their identity simply avoid potential immaturity and sexism from the men they play with. 

On the whole though, female gamers just seem to be people that like to play games and hang around others that do the same, and nothing more than that. Cool."

noname725,selfharm,1389947329.0,"I don't really talk about self-harm to anyone, but I have encountered a few stereotypes over the last decade. The ones that bother me the most are that self-harm is purely attention-seeking and that self-harm doesn't matter because it's self-inflicted.

I take issue with those because they invalidate self-harm and the various motivations behind it. Even if someone is self-harming for attention, it's still a pretty scary thing, you know? If someone is willing to go that far to get a little attention (and let's be real - EVERYONE wants at least some attention in their lives), then there's probably something going on with them that deserves to be addressed. I have never self-harmed for attention, so I guess I resent people thinking that about me since they are thinking of it in a very negative way. I also dislike the notion that self-harm doesn't really matter because it's self-inflicted because people don't seem to use their critical thinking skills and realize that there is probably a pretty big reason behind the self-harm. It also bothers me that people will accept other self-destructive behaviors - alcoholism, drug addiction, etc. - and have sympathy for those but not so for self-harm."

If I buy a broken product, the first thing I do is go to the retailer and ask for a replacement. If I can't get one, I'm on the phone with the manufacturer and I damn well expect compensation. I paid for a working product after all. I did not agree to buy ANYTHING ""as-is"" or ""sight unseen"". I bought it expecting it to work. I bought BF4 with literally NO disclaimers saying, ""This game may have game-breaking bugs that do not allow you to play and if you manage to get in a server, you may have problems that do not allow you to actually make any progress."" There were no disclaimers like that at all. We all bought a game expecting it to work.

Let's say the lawnmower it doesn't have a blade and you overlooked that at first and bought your own. You install the blade -- extra money on top of the original product -- fill it up with oil, give it some gas, only to find out that the gas tank has a leak. So you take it to a mechanic and they patch it up. But then when you get it back home, you find the oil tank has a leak. Shit, how could they miss that? You take it back, and now both are fixed, but the blade won't rotate!

So you take it back again and again and again and three months down the road, you are still trying to make this lawnmower worth your investment because all you want to do is fucking mow the lawn. That's all.

How would customers feel if they paid for a movie ticket only to find out that the film was 75% complete, with missing scenes and broken audio, despite all the trailers, all the director's comments, all the actors' appearances, led them to believe it was 100% complete? They'd rightfully want a refund. **Videogames should not get a free pass on quality assurance.**

I think asking for a developer to acknowledge that their game is in a poor state is really the least we could ask for. It'd save face on their end and make us, the customer, happy that they acknowledge they didn't release a product worth the 110 dollars that some of us paid for it in good faith.

But you are right. We are not owed an apology. But we ARE owed a game that actually works in a reasonable timeframe. That is what we paid for."

At this point you shouldn't actually want to date her anymore, because she appears to not have any romantic interest in you, which would make for a piss poor relationship. That's what infatuation is, it's the love of an idea. You don't know what she's like in bed, what her romantic emotional baggage is, what she's like in relationship fights, how emotionally needy or supportive she is, *nothing* important for maintaining a healthy relationship. You like the idea of being in a relationship with her, but you have no idea how it would actually be or if it would work at all. It's all just a fantasy you've built up in your head.

I encourage you to date around. You clearly aren't just completely uninterested in romance if you want to date your friend. Put your name on a dating website, or ask your friends if they know any single people. Remember that a date doesn't necessarily mean you have to commit to this person, or even go on a second one. It's no pressure. And who knows, maybe you'll meet someone who's a way better match than this girl you have your heart set on, as close a friend as she may be.

To your edit: both of those TRP ideas are crap. Even in your case, she's only withholding the truth to spare your feelings, which while that isn't the most praiseworthy thing to do, is understandable and not gender specific. And clearly she does care about your feelings, otherwise she would have no problem saying ""I just don't find you attractive"".

But since you asked about physical characteristics.... I don't know if this is true for most guys, because i really don't give a fuck about what other guys find desirable. But here's what I find hot.

I love curves on a woman.  Specifically, the curves from her waist to her hips and ass. I don't know the exact measurements. Boobs are nice too, but I'm definitely more an ass man. It's hot when a woman is toned.  I like a woman who looks like she goes to the gym to use more than the elliptical, not body builder ripped, but a girl that looks good in a sports bra and yoga pants.

Face- nice teeth, nice skin, nice smile. I prefer less make-up to more.  I hate overly plucked and then drawn on eye brows.  Long hair (shoulder length-ish) is typically hotter than short hair.

Around 5'6, or 5'7

That's my superficial list, though i could definitely still find a girl sexy even if she didn't meet (practically) any of items on my list."

And when she was at home late at night, she would look back on the day and marvel at how dumb every single other person was, how exhausting it was bantering and arguing about the same thing day in and day out.. How she knew her secret judgements and stereotypes about people were absolutely accurate.

Yet she would get up the following day and do it all over again, because that was her purpose.  It was what she was good at, and the people needed her."

While you're alive (and old enough to be a participating citizen) I do think you are responsible for doing your part to have your country to do what you believe to be the right things.

now team comps have to be more dynamic, what do we need ? a tank killer ? a DPS champ? A bursty champ ? how do we make them work ? to be honest we might see comps without adcs who find a way to compensate for pushing objectives (for example, a ziggs with lichbane does it really good too).

A Meta that is enforced by a type of champion isnt a healthy meta, an ""ADC"" champion shouldnt be a must, should be an asset that you have to analyse and decide is an asset you want in your team composition.

Anyway, I'll just dive right in...

Let me clarify my view on the limits of mockery. There are certain people who have clear disadvantages in life and whose weakness may make them behave in ways allowable for ridicule on occasion (depending on the severity of action) but whose actual genetic failings they never asked for and should generally not be rubbed in their face. That doesn't mean that we can never make fun of, say, someone with Down syndrome under any circumstance ever. It simply means not gleefully throwing their condition in their face. I'm sure there are mentally disabled individuals who have, on the balance, had a much easier and more enjoyable life than certain rich, privileged individuals. But as a rule of thumb, I think it's fair to say that it is more difficult being poor, disabled, unattractive, etc. than the reverse. That's why most people, not just liberal pussies, cut those individuals a tad bit of slack. 

Just think of the greatest difficulty you have in life that is beyond your control and imagine a stranger who doesn't appear to have experienced something as challenging as you have just laughing their ass off at you. Not because you acted wrongly, but because you *are* wrong. And your weakness is disgusting. Think how shitty that would make you feel. This isn't liberal whacko politics, it's not totalitarian mommy state doublespeak, it's simple human decency.

So who is your villain? The ""hipster."" A composite mythical creature sold to you by fashion magazines. How terrifying! And these hipsters are running the country? Is this a joke? You mean because they're a ""thing?"" A trending topic? Hipsters are an amorphous nothing label that applies to a broad range of middle class urbanites. That's it. They certainly aren't running the country. Most ""hipsters"" that I've run across are fairly politically apathetic and though some may pay lip service to political correctness (and many totally don't, actually), they can be huge assholes as well. Whatever sniveling crybaby you're imagining (or MDE made up for you) is a true rarity.

I think the worst you can say at all related to this point is that most people in creative fields are default, uncritical, nominal Liberals. But the suggestion that President Obama is catering exactingly to a carefully crafted hipster agenda is complete horse shit. The people who actually decide the fate of this country are the .01% in the higher rungs of finance, etc., leaders of industry, the most influential politicians, and on the very bottom of that top tier *maybe* athletes and actors, simply because they're such public figures. Someone making 65K at a graphic design firm in their 8th year in the business is not going to hold much sway over our domestic policy.

On the whole, I'm totally fine with aggressive, dark humor and I think it's okay to tease just about anyone within reason, so long as you read how well they play along. Completely disregarding a person's reactions and shitting on them to their face is sadism. It's not the crime of the century, but it is certainly not political activisim. 

There's plenty wrong with many Leftist ideas and practices. Political correctness frequently oversteps its bounds. The kind of malicious assholery in the ""Moms"" video is about as effectual in defeating those offences as a kid kicking his dog to spite his parents."

The hatred for Skyler has always bothered me. I've never seen such vitriol for a fictional character before. It honestly gets a little creepy sometimes how much these people hate her and want her to die. I get that she's not real, obviously, but it's telling of their attitudes toward real-life people (and women in particular)...and some of these people have even extended their hatred for Skyler toward Anna Gunn, which is totally NOT okay. 

It seems like a common phenomenon with TV and movies these days. People are always hating on the wives/girlfriends and other female characters who are opposite their favorite male characters. Many of these male characters are ""anti-heroes"" or are otherwise out there just doing bad things. Don from Mad Men has tons of fans and ardent defenders, but Betty and Megan constantly get blasted. Nucky and the various gangsters in Boardwalk Empire have tons of fans and people who think that they're ""badass,"" but everyone trashes the female characters like Margaret, Gillian, Angela, etc. Deb and Rita on Dexter get a lot of hate, but so many of the fans are totally on Dexter's side. People are harshly critical of Zoe and Claire on House of Cards, but they don't care what Frank does because they think he's funny and cunning. 

It gets really old being involved in fandoms in any way sometimes because of all of the hatred for the female characters. They aren't allowed to be complex or flawed like the male characters are. The second the female characters do something that the fans don't like, those characters are on the fans' shit lists forever and have no change of getting off...but yet the male characters can do horrible things (engage in infidelity, murder, rape/sexual assault, drug manufacturing and selling, other violence, etc.) and people will try their hardest to defend every action of theirs. It gets so old watching all of these people trying to put these female characters into little boxes and up on moral pedestals. 

Breaking Bad is such a good show and it's so well made and complex, so it's super frustrating seeing that so much of the fanbase is insufferable due to their hatred for Skyler...as well as Marie and Lydia and even Jane at times. There are very few pockets of the internet that are tolerable for Breaking Bad discussions because so much of the internet is polluted with this vitriol and these misunderstandings of the characters. I think that Skyler and even Marie are far more complex than a lot of these fans will acknowledge. I also think that their reactions are quite realistic and ""normal"" - they react in similar ways to how most real people would react. Most people would not be happy that their previously passive, decent husband suddenly turned into a violent, manipulative, lying meth-cooker in a *very* short period of time. 

Skyler's anger and depression make sense and are completely justified. People who hate her so much for not appreciating her husband's violent ways just seem confused. It also bugs me when they try to argue that Skyler is somehow 'worse' than Walt because, I don't know, she smoked a cigarette or two while pregnant. I've seriously seen people argue that before. I actually think that both Skyler and Marie are quite selfless. They care so much for their family and try to take care of everyone. Skyler protected her kids from knowing the truth for THEM, and she did it while everyone called her names and thought poorly of her, but she did it for her kids. Marie took care of everyone even when she wasn't being treated well and even when she didn't fully know what was going on. They are both good people.

I do think that Breaking Bad could've done a bit more with its female characters and I do think that most TV shows in general could do more and have better representation, but I also think that the female characters in Breaking Bad were pretty darn great. It sucks seeing them trashed and misunderstood everywhere. The level of vitriol is so high that it's actually quite misogynistic at times. It's really disheartening. I know that this is just a TV show, but I worry about the shitty attitudes a lot of these people must harbor in real life. "

""I don't know if I could do it! What if I gave the wrong judgement? What if Cerberus eats their souls instead? What if...""

""Fear not. All you have to do is judge fairly. There is nothing to fear but Zeus and the Pit,"" Thanatos reassured.

Then, he disappeared in a flock of crows leaving his famous Scythe clanking on the cold, hard floor of the Underworld. How am I going to be Death? I can't leave this place! I am a soul! I'm not Hermes that can go in and out of the Underworld nor a demigod like Hercules who steals and escapes this rotten place without a flinch, well maybe a lot of trouble, but he still got out alive.

The day is about to start. Souls should start flooding in soon. I am afraid. What if I send a soul that deserves Elysium into the Fields? There are ""what ifs"" here and there on my mind when I felt a tug on this long, black coat of mine. They were supposed to be faceless in front of Death. I didn't know Thanatos himself could peer into the entire life of the soul in seconds. Then, I made the judgement. I swung the Scythe and the soul disappeared in a flurry of smoke. A noticeable ""ting"" rung behind me and 800,871-A turned 800,872-A. Asphodel it is then.

As the day dragged on, I did the last soul. Peered into its life as I did. Then I saw a child, weeping on a corner with knees on his cheeks and arms around his legs. This soul was carrying a leather belt when he did this horrible thing to a child. A woman defends her child but gets slapped across the face instead. This soul was a drunkard and an abuser to his family. Towards the end of his life, I saw nothing but his vision vignetted with vivid blackness. He gasps for air, then I saw this faceless soul. I know him. I know this man. Killed by bare hands, strangling him to death, unable to breathe.

I raised my Scythe, ready for judgement. For the first time in my role as Death, I knew the decision. Then, I knew I tacked on another soul in the Fields as the counter raised by one.

Thanatos appeared for the first time since I saw him last.

""How was it?"" He says.

""Good,"" I replied.

""Have you given fair judgement?""

""I believe I have""

""Why?"" He asked quizzically, as if doubting the confidence in my answer.

GeeJo,NoStupidQuestions,1389948787.0,"There are solid reasons behind door number three being the ""least common nowadays"" (the so-called ""death of investigative journalism""). 

Imagine you run the news desk at a national paper/channel and one of your subordinates comes up to you claiming to have a decent lead on an interesting story that will *probably* pan out. You ask what resources they need to follow up on it and they come back with something like ""a week to chase it up, a camera guy to capture interview footage and the like, and maybe an intern to fill in the gaps and do the odd jobs that always end up taking an unnecessary amount of time."" Sounds reasonable, right?

On the other hand, you have a constant stream of press releases and announcements of press conferences arriving on your desk from big companies and politicians with the story already neatly packaged up and ready to go after the most cursory of fact checks. If you send that same journalist straight from one to the next for pre-arranged interviews and soundbites, they can get three or four stories covered in a day.

So, in the time it takes to complete a single investigative report that'll fill up a single feature slot *if it pans out* (which is never guaranteed), you could have *twenty* slots filled by doing the milk rounds. Suddenly that bit of investigative journalism doesn't look like such a good deal from a penny-pinching perspective.

After all, if the tip/story is that big of a deal, one of your competitors is bound to stumble across it and send someone. Let *them* do the expensive legwork! Sure you'll be a day or so behind if they do turn something up, but if a story has legs it runs for a week or so - one less day isn't *that* big a deal. And you can generally get decent enough footage sending someone to the scene after the fact, or by simply licensing it from wire services.

Except that all of your competitors have the same mindset. Nobody wants to front the cash, so very little actual investigative journalism actually gets done. It's so much easier, so much more certain and so much more profitable to chase the scheduled news releases now and let someone else hunt down bad guys. The failure of the Fourth Estate is just your garden-variety prisoner's dilemma, with everyone acting as a defector.

So-called ""citizen journalism"" is mopping up that gap in the market to some degree - untrained locals who hear that same tip and decide to investigate for themselves, then publish the story on the Internet. The ""real media"" can then piggy-back off of the amateurs' grunt work if it starts bearing real fruit. What I find really funny is that, if the story came from citizen journalists, there are always mainstream folks who immediately start jumping down their throats for poor fact-checking or unprofessional setups or whatever, blithely ignoring that it's only because professional investigative journalists *aren't doing their job* in the first place (or, more accurately, aren't allowed to do it) that there's so much unexploited space for citizen journalists to play around in.

Okay, gotten off on a bit of a tangent there. Apologies, rant over.

He was busy that day so we had to wait in his office for a few moments. Well these two kids, the girls was probably 4 or 5 and the boy was probably 3, open the door, creepily peak in, and start saying ""banana pants, banana pants"".  Then they creep in still chanting ""banana pants"" and shut the door never breaking eye contact. My husband looks over at me like ""Omg, PunkinNickleSammich, this is how we die.""  They slowly make their way over to us and the girl goes under the desk and ends up peering up at my husband through his legs and say ""banana pants"" while the boy came up behind us and the next to his sister. Neither of us had any idea what to do. Then, by the grace of all that is good, the vet came in and shooed the kids away.  They hung out out side the door and peered in at us a couple of times before we left. That was pretty freaky.  I now have a three year old. She says some pretty profound shit sometimes.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389949448.0,"I really like how you put this together. 

It really bothers me sometimes how ignorant these people are.This is usually how the conversation goes: I say that women aren't that hot after 30, ""Oh, so what your saying is that women are useless after 30?"" What? No, just objectively let's not kid ourselves, most men find women less physically attractive after 30. I'm not saying she's useless. ""Oh so your saying women are only good for being hot little arm candy?!"" No, I'm not saying that at all. Women can go on and do great things for society. We are just talking about looks here, and what I find sexually attractive, and that's youth -- prefferably youth mixed with intelligence.

I mean, no shit it's hard to find the intelligence of a 30 year old in a 23 year old's body. I rather have both. But realistically, at the end of the day, I'm going with the 23 year old and let her grow with me, so by the time she's 30, I've had her in her physical prime, and now I can have her in her intellectual prime. I'm not saying one person is objectively worse than the other as a person or contributor to society, but when it comes to mate selection, yeah, one seems to be better. This is a fucking ""sexual strategy"" sub. Don't think we are saying you are useless as human beings when you hit 30, that's ridiculous. 

&gt; &gt; An alpha male's value increases based on the amount of partners they can have 

&gt; We believe that women engage in ""Preselection"" in which the consensus opinion of other women matters a great deal more to them than it does to men.

I'd just like to clarify a bit. It's not even necessarily your value increases with the more women you sleep with as a form of ""preselection"". A man can still pass the preselection test without sleeping with any women at all. The key is, he's the **type of man that can sleep with many women**. If he turns them down for religious or personal reasons, that's fine. But objectively, the guy that rarely can find a girl to fuck is clearly less sexually valuable than the guy that either fucks women all the time, or the guy that can fuck quality women all the time but chooses not to. 

It's objectively true. I don't see how some people are confused with these basic topics. But even stating this usually cues the special snowflake, ""Oh, but I'M not like that. I personally prefer virgin men even though most women don't. It's my kink! Therefore, everything you just said is wrong!"" I hate those fuckers the most. "

Well, me being atheist and my husband being Baptist and both of us having seen too many movies were thoroughly creeped out. I threw it in the hallway and my husband said it had to stay. So anyway there a little back up story to add to these two...

-she told us that there was a cow that would show up at night beside her bed. He had horns and would stand on two feet. We asked if the cow was nice or mean ""mean!"".  What does he say to you? She then gave a low creepy growl... 

-she once bit her tongue and decided to paint the perimeter of her room in the blood.

-Also, she used to grab my breast at the grocery store while she was riding in the buggy and shove her face in them. She also tried to pull my tops down.

-she tries to make ""deals"" with me to get what she wants. She usually uses pretty big words for a three year old and puts on her business face when she does it.  She never follows through, though.

But I agree with what you are saying. Nutrition is the most important thing for me and its one of the reasons I am struggling to get below 1200 because I lack the knowledge to craft a meal plan that low (starvation low, as you mentioned) that still has everything my body needs.

I'm on a Paleo diet, after transitioning from a paleo-vegan diet, I have reintroduced meat and eggs. I have been told I have a gluten and lactose intolerance by my GI. My nutritionist and dietician have come up with some meal plans for me which I follow to the best of my ability to ensure my body gets what it needs. But they don't want to help me make one lower than 1500 because even though they agree that needs to be my net intake, they feel I should use exercise to get to that. I had my BF% and my BMR calculated by the nutrionist, my active BMR is 1572, which is why exercise is so important if I want to lose weight while eating 1500 a day.

I guess it just feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. The best thing for my body is to stay on my current, professionally designed meal plan, and increase my exercise, But some days My body wont let me, and I'm not getting any support."

* The PW is almost definitely in E2. I don't think Shae and Tyrion will get a chance to speak before the wedding. This means Shae and Tyrion will have parted on bad terms, with Shae believing Tyrion was now in love with Sansa and wanted her gone. 
* After the wedding, Sansa is a suspect. Cersei and/or Tywin will convince her she has to testify against Tyrion to absolve Sansa. Shae will reluctantly do so. 
* Shae will feel guilt over testifying against Tyrion, despite parting on bad terms. When Tyrion loses his trial, she will go to Tywin to beg for leniency for Tyrion. Cue sexy time.

malross,acne,1389950380.0,"None of this giving up on life business. You're 16, which is not to be dismissive of your problem based on age, so remember you are just right in the middle of the hard part. That's all it is. You're just facing down the tough bit. The key is to be patient. Trust your doctor cause what they are giving you takes time to work. Think 4-6 weeks to see results from anything. Ask your doctor questions about when you should be expecting results and what to look for. Sounds like your doctor is taking a very reasonable, cautious approach before considering the big scary drug, Accutane. It is a wonder drug but has the most horrific side effect list you will ever read. That thing is no joke and if you can avoid it, thank the stars.

Remember, acne is temporary. Mine has stayed with me but cleared up majorly around 23. I don't even think about it anymore cause it doesn't have a damn thing to do with how fantastic I am and it doesn't have a damn thing to do with how great you are. It's just spots on your skin and they're fun to pop. Don't let them stress you out too much. Remember there is a big community of people here ready to help you get through the tough part, a challenge I know you're going to rock.

p.s. When you shave, run a little hydrogen peroxide through your razor then rinse with water right before. It will clear the bacteria that tends to hang out on the blades from the last time you shaved. Probably won't make a big difference but it will help."

Polyethylenes,changemyview,1389950502.0,"I think that most people who use those kinds of words have just been educated that way, wether it comes from the parents or friends, they learnt that those words were ok to use. The word ""gay"", for example, is used a lot by teenagers and younger children, this is because when you're 7-10 years old  you don't really know what it means. So when you hear someone, like a popular kid or a friend use the the word to describe something lame, that's what you'll be using too. But you don't know what it is at this age, so to you it's just another synonym of ""lame"" or something like that.

You continue using this word when you're older because you're used to it, and you probably don't have a lot of gay people in your entourage that could be offended by it, so it's not a big deal and you don't think much of it. And that's how it becomes anchored in your language, that's how you see yourself using it a lot along with other ""hate words"" as such.

But that doesn't mean you hate gays, or jews, or whatever, it's a joke to you and it's not going further than a synonym. Some people might use it as hate speech but I think it's unfair to generalize since a lot of its use comes from habit or education, it doesn't mean they are homophobic or racist.

I'm not saying using these words is okay, it just doesn't mean the same thing to the people using it.

As Louis CK said, straight men are the only type of sexuality that are concerned about being confused for another. That's why the word gay is so popular as an insult, because of the insecurity of men regarding their sexuality."

When my dad was in his mid-twenties he and a some of his best friends from the army decided to tour around South Africa, Botswana and Namibia for a couple of weeks. They hired a native guide and traveled around in a jeep. At night they would camp in tents and abandoned huts, when they could find them. 

One night they were all awoken by someone screaming just outside of their hut. They stumbled outside to find their guide being dragged away by a lioness; it had calmly wandered into their campsite while they were sleeping and grabbed the guide as a midnight snack. Naturally they stood there in shock; unsure what to do, but then one of my dad's friends pulled out his hand gun. He proceeded to walk up to the lioness, put the gun to its head and shoot it at point blank range. Luckily for him the lioness was too preoccupied with dragging the guide to pay him any attention. I can't remember for sure, but I think they were able to patch up the guide and get him to a hospital.

At 21, I didn't really know squat about myself, the world, or where I was going either.

Hell, I'm here at almost 34, and STILL when I'm asked ""What do you want to do with your life?""  I'd stare blankly at someone.

I'm a rent a cop with three kids and an amazing wife.  But what do I want to *do*?  I honestly don't know.  Be happy?  Be a great person?  What am I *supposed* to want to do?

At 21 it may seem like stuff is figured out, but it honestly wasn't until I hit 30 that I started to truly realize where my life was, and how I wanted to shape it, and the steps I could start to actively have that happen.

Choices?  Accept it.  Handle the depression bit, encourage some thinking via asking some of those Bigger Questions About Life and ask him to really look into it.  Tell him *right then* that you'll give him a week to dive into the topic, because you'd really like to dig in and figure it out with him.

If he doesn't work towards it, express your need to connect in that way, attempt it again.

If it doesn't work, time for the harder choices.  Keep up with this or move on if it's important to you.

They sound like awesome people, and when you hide things from them you are sabotaging your relationship. 

It also sounds like you haven't told them about your past abuse, or not to the extent that they need to know so they can give you the support that you need. 

I can tell you that they already KNOW something is up. So unless you want to spend the next 6 days lying, you are going to need to talk to them.

I don't know your partner's schedule but it sounds like you need to schedule some alone time with her and have a very long talk about how you feel. For any relationship to work you have to be who you are. Hiding your bad side does not make the relationship longer. It makes it more dysfunctional in the long run.

Before having the talk think about what you need. Think about the boundaries you need with your meta-more and your partner.

Use bigger sized condoms if you plan on actually enjoying the sex. The only times I had to use condoms was when my SO (who's always been on the pill since we've been together) had had diarrhea or needed to take antibiotics, so there was increased risk of failure. It came to a point where I would flat out decline sex if it had to be with a condom, because I would simply not enjoy it. So she went out and bought bigger sized condoms (note, this is Europe, so we have wider variety of choice), and after using those once or twice, I have to say, the difference is pretty staggering."

Maybe if you have a dedicated book-scanning setup that automatically flips pages, but even then, flipping 500 pages, taking pictures of each, uploading them, running them through OCR, doing quality control/editing to clean up the inevitably mediocre text output, join pages together...and god help you if the book has pictures or math or non-traditional formatting (e.g. Jonathan Safran Foer).  And if you don't have an OCR setup, what you're gonna flip hundreds of pages and run them through your desktop scanner?

All of that takes a lot of time and effort and dedicated hardware, the quality will vary hugely, and it's still not nearly the same end-result as having the book.  Sure, it's *possible* to get the majority of content out of most books into digitally distributable format, but you can't seriously pretend it's comparable to ripping a CD.  

Anyone with a computer can rip a perfect copy of a CD with a couple clicks and less than an hour of twiddling their thumbs.  Book scanning requires a special setup to do it remotely quickly, plus lots of editing and hands-on attention to get it into a digestible form.

I feel bad for the fresh meat. We all had to start somewhere but at this moment in time the newbies get beaked mercilessly. You have a shit game, you are trying a new build, you are trying a new character all get you taunted. ""Go play practice"" one might say. While this is a fair point, I want to test these things against thinking people so I can see where the weakness is in the character or my build. After a match or two, if we lose, I will know if the character is for me or not or where the flaws in my build are. 

Furthermore, this is a team based game. You win as a team and you lose as a team. I find it unacceptable that players will say shit like ""I am not carrying this whole team"" or ""I am not going to kill anymore because you aren't putting effort in, I am dropping."" If your are doing work, with little help from your team keep it up. Sure, they may ride your coat-tails for a match, but your alternative is losing. Suck it up and keep playing, plus more kills and such boost your stats. Just play smart and don't die a bunch. 

Finally, players need to learn to take advice in a team setting. I was in a match tonight where the Geb player went tank build, yet still insisted on getting kills and taking the attack buff. None of which, at least in my eyes, are the duty of the tank. He wasn't assisting the team he was just out for kills. I said ""Geb, why did you take the Atk buff?"" which was greeted with ""Because fuck you that is why."" Look, I am not trying to trash talk you, so why are you giving me shit. You are not playing the role to its most effective means, and like I said to him, the Atk buff would be better suited to one of our attackers on the field. 

You guys can be real assholes sometimes. That being said, I have done my fair share of beaking when the occasion has called for it. But we just need to remember this is a team based game with new and improving players it is part of the game so best not be a twat waffle about it. "

xgloryfades,AskReddit,1389951669.0,"Edit: I just read your post back and I know you're trying to help, so thanks! 

My brain can come up with so many goings wrong for every situation. Let's say I try something new and I don't like it well I'd have to eat it and pretend I liked it because I paid for it. I couldn't send it back because then it would take longer and what if the person I was with finished first and I'd be making them wait while I ate? That wouldn't be fair and they'd probably resent me and be thinking horrible things and what if I sent it back and the waiter went to the kitchen and they all laughed at me or were annoyed at having to change it so they'd mess with it in some way (I know they wouldn't because it's not worth risking their jobs over but my mind still throws up that scenario). And I couldn't tell the person I was with that I didn't like it because they'd encourage me to send it back and I'd get into the flap I just described. Yet at the same time pretending to like it to avoid that situation could mean that the person I'm with thinks I like it so what if they decide to cook it for me one day? I'd have to eat it and pretend to like it all over again. And with new foods what if there's something in there that I'm allergic to? 

The level of worry and analysis my brain goes into is exhausting so it's easy to fall into a routine. 

None of these issues are present with food I know and like so I stick with the easy option. In a Chinese place I don't even have to look at the menu, if they have chicken chow mein I'm golden.

I personally don't have faith that humanity can pull off ideas like basic income, nor can I imagine people still being productive when the survival no longer depends on being a wage slave. 

I know I would probably disappear into a virtual reality MMO and never return. I would be completely useless to society.

Silvertaste,WritingPrompts,1389952625.0,"Are you Canadian? I only ask because I think English provincials are a Canadian only thing.

Considering the quite constraining time limits you have for provincial English exams, I think you got in some nice characterization, and good story, and some solid visuals. And, since the writing topics are always fairly broad, it's written in a way you can fit it into any of them!

I can offer some advice though, as someone who graduated from a Canadian high school and wrote a few English provincials. Turn up the sappiness to 11. This was the best thing my English teacher told me when I was in high school. The people who grade these are generally older ladies who love feel-good stories about romance or family or the environment. I'm definitely not saying you won't get a good mark by writing science fiction, and like I said your story is very solid for a high school exam, but just take the feel-good aspect into account. You definitely already have some too! So maybe just expand on the relationships and feelings of your characters. Don't be afraid to add some back story in to make them really care about these people who are about to die. 

However, if you are not a Canadian high school student I apologize. But still keep this in the back of your head! It served me well on my provincials (I got 97 on my final one) and I hope it can help you too. I wrote sci-fi as well for one of them, so don't feel like you have to change what you're comfortable writing at all either!

Good luck. :) "

SirJefferE,Showerthoughts,1389952817.0,"That's a pretty modern interpretation of Medusa, probably to make her look a bit scarier and also give her a bit more credibility as a villain.

Traditional Medusa is still humanoid, but with snakes instead of hair. I would argue that it is only the hair on her head, as I believe a special note would have been made in the case of armpit hair, pubic hair, leg hair, arm hair, facial hair, and any other hair that might find their way onto her body.

As far as I can tell, historic depictions back me up fairly well here. There's [this example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Medusa_by_Carvaggio.jpg) from Caravaggio; take note of the eyebrows, which are plainly human hair. Or [this pediment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Close_up_of_Gorgon_at_the_pediment_of_Artemis_temple_in_Corfu.jpg) at the Museum of Corfu, and the oldest depiction we have of Medusa. Note the legs, rather than a tail.

You learn a lot about him as a character, how he views the world, the games he plays. Listen to his monologue and think about how what is saying can be applied to other themes in the book.

Particularly the line about ""They just paid you, they know what you are. They know it's all just an act. Your job is to make them forget what they know, and that takes time. You need to ease into it."" 

Very similar to his statements about the realm, power, knowledge. He came from nothing to be on the King's Council and is wealthy and powerful. Also it shows that Littlefinger is cold, calculating, precise, not one to get caught up in the fact there are two beautiful woman having sex near him. He doesn't lose his cool, and he keeps his wits about him. Instead of getting caught up in being voyeuristic or being drawn into them, or even teaching them himself, he goes into a monologue, looks away, walks around the room. 

And then it continues some more. Think about what he is coaching them to do. He is a master at manipulation, and deception and is a weasel and scoundrel. Everything about the brothel scenes is important because they give you information and context to the characters.

So don't watch it again, listen to it and then tell me if that scene doesn't contribute."

iamck94,Military,1389953556.0," this is a perfect example of someone's personal views affecting their perception of a movie. too jingoistic and violent? its a fucking war movie. true you can have war movies without patriotism (platoon, apocalypse now..etc.) however its like horror movies without gore; there are some with it and some without it, but it isn't uncommon for it to be a theme in the movie. 
""Lone Survivor just reads like a quasi-political exaggeration of a slasher film: the cellphones that don't work, the rescuers just out of reach, the killers chasing our victims through the woods."" okay well thats exactly what happened, you cant fault a movie for using this as a convenience to advance the plot when it actually happened.
""We wanted that fight at the highest volume,"" Wahlberg says, ""the loudest, coldest, darkest, most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights."" OK, but did the local villagers whom we see get caught in the crossfire want that fight?"" Again, THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED you cannot fault a movie for recounting what happened. Now I'll be honest, I don't really like over the top, motivated, and overly patriotic themes; I've just never liked how Black Hawk Down was super ""hooah"" as the Army would say. Still, it was a decent movie that I liked and just because I didn't like certain themes in the move, doesn't mean that I'm just going to hate the movie overall."

Blozi,teenagers,1389953750.0,"1) Again, It's controversial whether 'gender identity' is even a legitimate thing or not. Not everyone believes in it. There are no facts that state having any gender other than male and female is even possible. Remember, in order to be a legitimate gender, there must be brain differences in each gender. That fact proves 'gender-fluid' to be bullshit, unless that person had a high unstable brain.

&gt;I'm not the one making assumptions

You're assuming that gender identity is a real thing. How do you know it's real? And don't just tell me ""Because the cool kids on tumblr said they're genderqueer so that means they are!""

2) So they can choose whatever gender they want because they *feel* like it. I feel like I'm a dinosaur right now. Am I a dinosuar? No. You can't just choose whichever gender you feel like having. That makes the entirety of gender completely illegitimate and useless.

3) I really don't think you know what the word ignorant means. You also didn't answer my question -- again. I'll post it here for you again: They can call me edgy for not believing in gender identity, but I can't call them edgy or else I'm ignorant? So if I call them edgy that makes me ignorant. If they call me edgy what does that make them? Ahoy, double standards!

&gt;If you had approached it in a way that didn't seem insulting to genderqueer people, then maybe you wouldn't be in this situation.

Ahoy, more double standards! You really think they approached me in a friendly manner? Like they were just so happy to hear what I had to say? Did they really seem oh-so open-minded? Nope. They were dicks, so I was a dick back.

GeeJo,DnD,1389953887.0,"The problem with introducing magic is that either it has to be at such a low level that it doesn't actually affect all that much, (meaning that the siege will play out more or less normally) or it completely obsoletes any other approach. It would likely turn out completely ahistorically. The vast majority of real sieges ended when the defenders ran out of food or water. Magic does away with (or at least massively reduces) that restriction.

So, the siege would have to be broken through an assault. The sheer destructive potential provided by magic goes above and beyond what was available to gunpowder weapons, which themselves broke the dominance of the castle as a military focal point. All defences not built with magic specifically in mind are basically useless if the enemy brings enough mages with them. And the attacker is *always* going to have a force advantage over the defender or they wouldn't be trying to siege in the first place. The effectiveness of walls as a defensive measure simply doesn't scale up as quickly as the destructive potential offered by larger numbers of spellcasters.

If you're running a campaign with any semblence of realism and intelligent actors, even magically-enhanced walls are more or less just a speed-bump for a mage-equipped assault force. Not even that, if the attackers get creative. The only viable defence tactic is to force a protracted engagement *within* the city and hope that the attacker has some reason not to just level the place. Magical Stalingrad, basically, with ambush tactics and hit-and-run operations looking to do as much damage while remaining mobile enough not to get pinned down.

On the other hand, if you use DM fiat to insist that the walls cannot fall except by regular siege action, you can still play around with other tactics. Small assault teams can be teleported, plane-shifted, or just flown into the city to disrupt operations or attempt to open the gates at night. Any defenders who die can be raised to fight their former friends, etc. Summoned assassins to take out enemy leadership."

Chrozon,AskMen,1389954620.0,"Music is really important to me. I play the piano, bass, guitar and drums, and I sing in a choir.

I started with piano cause everyone in my family plays it, but I wasn't a big fan of all the practice and sheet music so I stopped going to a teacher. I then picked up a drumset when I was around 10 and started playing, mostly stuff like Green Day.

I then got an electric guitar when I was around 14 and started practicing that.

I joined a band as a drummer when I was around 16, where we mostly played punk rock covers, it was pretty fun.

I kept practicing everything for a while, then I took a year when I was 19 to go to a kind of community college where there is no grades or anything, just fun classes and you live in a dorm and make friends for a year. I took the music course. I was planning on playing drums, but since there were so many drummers, I decided to play the piano instead.

We recorded an album of different cover songs, [This was one](https://soundcloud.com/torstein-r-sok/lazlo-bane-superman-fredtun) that I arranged and played piano on (And sang a little backup).

After that I went on with my studies, and joined a semi-professional choir. I don't really have any instruments anymore (since I moved away from home), except my acoustic and electric guitar, which is very sad, and I miss playing piano and drums a lot.

I love every single genre (which is not an exaggeration), but my favorites are funk/soul, smooth jazz, fusion jazz, progressive metal, video game music and modern choral (whitacre, lauridsen).

I also love the studio, mixing and engineering, and if the world was perfect I'd definitely want to run my own studio. [This](https://soundcloud.com/torstein-r-sok/dtdemo2) is the start of a Castlevania arrangement that I started recording, but gave up cause I didn't have the time. I play all the parts, except the drums (cause it's way too expensive to record real drums).

So yeah, Tl;DR music is awesome and I wish I had the time and money to pursue it as a career..."

tangerinelion,news,1389954928.0,"Suppose all the major ISPs demand that Netflix pays them extra money or they will get throttled traffic.  Perhaps this violates a collusion law or something like that, it doesn't change the fact that the premise is entirely plausible.  Now, what does Netflix do?

If they don't pay, then users see bad Netflix performance.  What do they do?  Some complain to their ISP.  Most blame Netflix.  Many will simply cancel Netflix and retain their ISP since there is a monopoly in many regions.

What happens when Netflix loses a lot of customers?  Well, they're not making as much revenue so they can't pay for as much content.  So it gets stale and more customers drop.  Now they can raise prices to bring in better content, but more people will drop at the price raise.  OK, cool, so Netflix is dead.

So, back up.  We know Netflix can't handle being throttled.  So, they pay up to the ISPs.  Maybe the charge is fairly minimal and they don't need to increase prices, but they work with reduced profits.  As above, this means they have a little more trouble with fresh content and they'll probably see a slight drop in customers.  Which hurts profits more.

OK, so they can't be throttled and they can't keep prices the same.  So they pass on the cost to customers.  Some will leave, and the important thing is for Netflix to estimate how many will leave and set prices so that the reduced number of users at the new rate will give them the same profits.

However, now ISPs have a new source of revenue from (essentially) extorting other companies.  What do they do?  Build a platform like Netflix themselves and offer it for lower rates.  And since they are the ISP they automatically get the unthrottled service.

If an ISP has a monpoly, there's absolutely no reason for them not to do this.  They could even do this only in the areas they have a monopoly - Netflix would have fun calculating how to raise the rate to keep everything balanced with that."

Takuya-san,LearnJapanese,1389955069.0,"I would say that even 100 per day is doable but that'd be the absolute realistic max. It really depends on how much free time you have.

Keep in mind that the required time for learning and reviewing kanji goes up exponentially with the number of kanji. 40 kanji per day is doable with 45 to 90 minutes of study per day with Anki, depending on your memory and efficiency.

70 kanji per day would likely take 3+ hours per day. 100 would take at least 5 or 6 hours. Consider that you need to take breaks every 30 kanji or so and that you need to review increasingly large numbers of previously studied kanji and you can see where the 100 absolute maximum figure comes from. 
That's why I recommend around 35. Definitely doable in around 1 hour per day, every day, as long as you focus work efficiently and do all of your Anki reviews every day.

You can try 50 if you can commit to 2 hours or so per day, but beware of burnout. The first few days are easy but if you're not a superhuman you will probably burnout and get tempted to quit. First few days will be doable in less than an hour but the study work piles up fast. 

Edit: Also note that this won't allow you to read newspapers or books. This simply allows you to write and recognise all of the kana and most common kanji. You still need actual vocabulary for that, and that will take extra time. 

You will be able to pick up and read children's manga and anime to begin with, and move on from there.

Newspapers need more kanji and complex vocab. It will take at least a year before you can begin to read them without immense difficulty. "

letsgocrazy,forwardsfromgrandma,1389955790.0,"&gt;So... these photos don't contradict when you think about it. 

&gt;The first woman is essentially saying that society has taught us that harassment of women is an acceptable behavior as it dictates their attractiveness. In this vein of 

Has society taught us that it's acceptable, or that it is unacceptable, but not really dealt with the severity. 

I know construction firms etc come down on it like a tonne of bricks. 

I think it's a bit glib to say ""society teaches us it's acceptable"" because for the most part it doesn't. 

&gt;reasoning, the number of wolf-whistles/cat-calls becomes a metric of how attractive a woman is. (The more harassment, the more attractive). She needs feminism because she wants her self-worth to be decoupled from harassment.  

How does this comment go unnoticed? 

Where on earth does the amount of whistles and cat-calls become a metric? 

It's just an unfortunate circumstance. 

Like having large boobs. Is the amount of comments and remarks a metric of how large your tits are? Of course not. Their size is. The comments etc are just a side effect. 

I'm all for completely eradicating all circumstances where people call out to women in this way, but it's not an excuse to take it all the way to the finals of the suffering Olympics. 

I hate the glib unproven grandiose bullshit of feminism. 

No society does to condone that behavior. 

A small subset of a particular type of people do. The law is unable and unwilling to go to any great lengths to deal with it for a variety of reasons. 

No, it is not metric for judging your attractiveness. That doesn't even make sense. 



&gt;As for the second woman, she needs feminism for a different reason. Feminism teaches others that normalizing and disregarding harassment is not acceptable. 

Feminism also seems to make shit up. 

Pretty much every construction firm in the UK (the traditional bastion of shouting at women who walk by) now has tough rules to stamp out this behaviour and it works. 

Most other places don't have this problem. 

The law can't do anything if harassment is not continual, unprovable and the consequences are deemed to be little more than hurt feelings. 

Now, think about your daily grind. How often do you see this kind of stuff? 

Not that often. Why not that often? Because society takes it very seriously. 

What would happen in your work place if you started shouting or making comments as women walked by? "

Nabucco? That passed through Turkey, not Syria. It's canceled anyway. South Stream, the alternative, passes through the Black Sea and through Russia still.

&gt;And I wonder, given America and Canada's new-found love for fracking and my country's ability to start becoming a net exporter soon, if we could keep Europe afloat during such a scenario?

I actually don't think fracking will be more than a stopgap without much long-term impact. Renewables are the only sources whose supply cannot be cut off. Fossil fuels will always cause dependency.

&gt;In any case, I believe if such a threat was truly and seriously undertaken, the Middle East, which is where a huge portion of energy for Europe comes from, would become the new proxy battlefield for Russia &amp; the European Union, a Great Game 2.0 if you will.

It's already somewhat like that, with Russia supporting Iran/Syria in general. European gas imports are only 7% from the Middle East. Crude oil is 35% from the Opec, which includes non-Middle East countries, so it's less than expected.

It's written form, which is almost identical to Hebrew, doesn't reflect that.

tangerinelion,cpp,1389956159.0,"Wait, are you using C strings or C++ strings?

Your description sounds C-string like.  For example, removing all ""x"" characters:

    char* Remove(const char* str, char x) {
        const n = std::strlen(str);
        char* newStr = new char[n+1];
        char* out = newStr;
        for(const char* in=str, end=str+n; in != end; ++in) {
            if(*in != x) {
                *(out++) = *in;
            }
        }
        *out = '\0'; // terminate your stuff
        return newStr;
     }

This, however, sucks.  For example Remove(Remove(myStr),'x'),'y') would remove all 'x' and 'y' characters from myStr - but would also leak memory.  A client would need to do

     char* noX = Remove(myStr,'x');
     char* result = Remove(noX,'y');
     delete noX; noX = 0;

or the marginally less terrible
 
    char* result = 0;
    { // scope noX
        char* noX = Remove(myStr,'x');
        result = Remove(noX,'y');
        delete noX;

C++ strings at least push this new/delete business into the class.  You could do something similar, or take advantage of the find() or replace() methods."

Stuff like mirror force might seem good, but a good hieratic player will know how to use su on top of all the spell back row hate to clear out any backrow that doesn't stop them comboing. 

Effect negation is good, provided you have a way to clear their field before they just resume next turn. 

Maxx c is awesome is some decks, because it gives you a lot of draws, and forces them to either commit to the otk or stop pretty soon. Because of the first option, make sure that you run something that you can draw into the save yourself, or always have enough traps to stop them otking if they do decide to push.

However, maxx c isn't great in some decks, because not every deck can actually use that huge number of cards in hand in any efficient way, if you survive.

Some traps like vanities emptiness, light imprisoning mirror and mask or restrict can be decent, and maky lock them down. However, the deck is one of very few that can main deck a heavy storm style card in wingbeat of a giant dragon, so while they may be more functional than stuff like mirror force in stopping them pushing through, don't be surprised if they do just push through. 

Deck depending, stuff like abyss dweller and steelwarm roach can cause some issues, but that depends on the competence of the player to know when to use them. 

They are a good deck, and are pretty tough to face if the player knows what he is doing with them. However, as a hieratic player, I know a lot of my wins come from people not understanding what the deck does, because they keep hearing overly simplistic statements about side decks etc, without really understanding the match up (mirror force being good against hieratics is a standard misunderstanding, because less experienced hieratic players won't pop the traps, or respect them enough if they can't). 

Stuff like emptiness may just win some games, but others they will sit there, knock out the emptiness and another back row with a mst, then proceed to otk you. "

I've been proven wrong on every plane (intellectual, physical, social, ...), yet the notion lingers. It's some kind of mental disconnect, some kind of protection mechanism which kicks in (*'well at least I'm taller, even if he's better at everything else'*).

Also, as /u/Beigis mentions, when abroad and one of the taller ones for a change, the 'these are my minions' feelings pop up very easily. I compare it to scolding every other road warrior for driving your tiny car off the road, and later stepping into a BMW M5 and realizing you're doing the exact same thing to tiny cars in front of you.

 Ureaplasma urealyticum can be found in the genitourinary tract (mucosal surfaces of the cervix or vagina) of 40 – 80% of sexually active women, many of whom are healthy and asymptomatic. Women are considered a reservoir for this. It is much less common in men.

So, the first one: she could very well have been infected before you two got together.

The last two are commonly present in humans and can cause problems. The fact that she is having problems with them now does not mean she was sexually active with someone else in the very recent past, it just means they are causing her problems now.

What you want to taste most beans is going to be in the City/Full City range.  Roughly ""medium roast"" for those that label that way.  But this varies too by bean so don't take that as absolute.  Short version is avoid French/Italian roasts.

your features are however good, and with the right style (very feminine and delicate girly style) make you appear totally feminine and gorgeous.

ScaredycatMatt,Gunners,1389957310.0,"It seems for many it's all about getting the most 'high ceiling' technical players on the pitch regardless of how well it works. Right now, Giroud clicks in this team and we've got the best balance across the pitch that I've seen in years.

He's capable of receiving the ball to his feet and also provides an aerial option. It's been a long time since we could play it out from the back or kick it down the pitch to our striker. I honestly think this is a big part in why we're doing so well this season, we're a lot less predictable than we have been in previous years. Before it was all about 'Get the ball to Song, he kicks it to RVP', or 'Get the ball out to Sagna, who will pass to Walcott who then passes inside to the midfield who give it to Sagna on the overlap', then Sagna would cross in and we would have nobody in there to challenge.

Add in a 'pacy, runs in behind' kinda guy as our main forward and you lose that aerial option, in most cases. We go back to opposition sides being happy to let everything come down our right side since they know Sagna's crosses won't actually *do* anything without a big guy in there challenging. Even if Giroud doesn't put them away every time, the fear of him being able to challenge these defenders is still there. Which would obviously make them less comfortable with everything coming down the right hand side, since Sagna's crossing can be quite effective if there's a man in there.

I dunno, maybe I'm in the minority here but I like having someone who can do this job in the team. Not be a technical expert or a master of finishing, but enables us to approach games in several different ways and is quite effective at whatever we choose to do."

Here's a heads up: If you think men and women should be treated and act differently, that's *not* equality."

Lösningen på tågproblematiken tror jag är att man vågar skjuta till mycket pengar för underhåll, samtidigt som man bygger nya banor för det nya seklet.

You tell your girlfriend, and end the relationship.  It's the only fair thing to do for both of you.

Why spend your entire life striving to attain something you may never even have, especially when shooting for the stars (heaven) doesn't grant you the possibility of landing on the moon--it lands you in your grave. Why even believe that an [eternal] afterlife is worth having? Imagine the monotony; the never-ending nature of that new existence. Part of the reason we *do* value the lives we have now is because it has a time limit. Granted, it's not the only reason, but you'd have to be pretty out of touch to think it *isn't* a reason. Part of the problem is that the Christian heaven requires nothing more than mere belief in Jesus, warrenting any excuse that striving to get to heaven makes us better people unfounded. Like I already said: It's OK to believe whatever you want, but if it takes anything away from the value you have for what we know is real based on actual evidence, then maybe you need to reexamine your priorities a little."

Scumbag employers use their employees' time, energy, body, creativity, ingenuity, without regard for the person behind those traits. Given the chance, there are those that will use another person up until they are nothing left and move on the next.

But there are also good employers that don't do this, that see their employees as people that exist beyond the work they can provide.

Scumbag 'friends' will use others for their time, attention, resources, without giving anything back. They will also use someone as long as they can get away with it and then do the same to the next person.

But there are also good, actual friends that don't do this.  They see their relationships as two way streets, and give back. They value their friends as people with their own needs, not just for the support they can provide.

And there are also scumbag people who will use the vision of another 'just to get off,' who would also say what they had to say, and do what they had to do to get that person's body.  

But there are also people that don't do this. There do exist loving relationships where people are loved and valued on a deep level, and the sex is just as much about building each other up, building the relationship up, as it is about fulfilling the body's needs.

There are also casual encounters that don't use people up and spit them out.  Two people can come together and have very intense, passionate, mutually fulfilling sexual experiences with no desire to commit to each other, or need to expand beyond much farther than the sex.  It isn't unlike to two people performing any activity together, building an enhancing friendship, and having no intention to do anything beyond that. Like sport teams, running, lifting, etc. *(I think the nature of the physical movement, exertion, and perhaps intensity might actually be important for the kind of bonding I'm thinking of)*

There are many ways to objectify people, to view and treat them as if they have only one use, and are to be used.  And there are people that almost exclusively see others this way.  Many of us fall prey to this way of thinking, from both ends, from time to time.

But many people do this rarely. And once you learn to spot scumbag people who use others habitually, it is easy to minimize contact with them. Ridding them from your life doesn't mean they stop existing. But you get to see much more good than bad in people, which is very uplifting.

**TL;DR: Seeing someone as sexually beautiful, or intriguing, does not have to be any more objectifying than seeing them for any other single trait they have. There are scumbags that use people in all different ways, sexually just being one of them.  But there are also plenty of non-scumbags that give back to others, and appreciate them for themselves, not just what they have to offer.**

On to your other points: Of course you don't care.  You became a booty call. The ""Friend"" part of the FWB was essentially dropped.  And sadly it happens. I've seen it and sadly in my youth, I've done something similar.  When you put up walls like that to keep things from getting to real, you form this sort of disconnect.  It's not right, and it's something he has hopefully learned not to do in  the future.

As to your question on what to do:  The main question here is whether or not you're ready to date on a serious level yet.  If the answer is no, then just say ""See you later"" and go from there. If the answer is yes, then you need to figure out if he is the guy you'd like to attempt dating again with.  

Personally if you aren't at least 90% into the idea of legit dating this guy, then just part ways and see if the friendship can be salvaged at least.  You seem like a nice girl, and apparently are a tiger in the sack (take him at his words, and don't doubt yourself).

The best possible scenario for me would be, that people change the world everyone lives in. So if someone destroys town X, then town X shouldn't be destroyed for only half of the players. 

I guess it even could be done if we take a system like GW2 (where events trigger the next event) and make it bigger. Like Phase 1 is an attack on a town and the players have to defend. If defense doesn't work then Phase 2 starts where we have a destroyed town and players have to build it up again. If that's successful Phase 1 starts again. Now this is of course a very simple example and you could add a lot of different phases with different forks. Each Phase should take some time, so not just an hour, but more like a week. This way players could actually change the world for everyone and you won't need any phasing. 

Megaservers itself don't need phasing, they need instancing... which is even more bad in my opinion. I hate to be in a group where I have to ask: ""I am in Town X#162, where are you?"" - ""Oh, I am in Town X#13.""

I think over all you'd have a harder time arguing that anthropology doesn't have a place in this sort of research. It seems that a lot of conservation policies (i.e. national wildlife parks) are predicated on a myth of ""the wilderness"", completely ""untamed"" by human beings. Perhaps oral histories and ethnographies may give a more in depth and nuanced understanding of the use of the land. 

Needless to say any of these efforts needs to be interdisciplinary, and recruit the efforts of archaeologists and geologists etc. to determine shifts in demographics occupying and using land, and how that historically has been done.

ctesibius,Christianity,1389959042.0,"Your views are normal in most of the world. A literal interpretation of the whole Bible was a 19C USAian trend, not a tradition of Christianity.

There are parts of the Bible which were intended to be taken literally (the gospels accounts of the life and acts of Jesus, for instance) and parts which were never meant to be taken literally (poetic imagery, parables, hyperbole). You will need to sort out which is which, but it's generally not hard. 

This does not mean that you discard the creation stories (Gen 1 and Gen 2 are different stories). While not literally true, they are there for a reason. I'd suggest that some of the key points are:

* God created the universe - heaven and earth. This might sound a trite observation now, but every other creation story had the universe create the gods - for instance an egg might hatch bearing a first god, or gods might emerge from a primordial swamp. This is sometimes called the ""metadivine"" - that which is beyond and above the gods. The Bible says that God came first, and had no prior cause, and he created the universe. At one time, this was a radical message - remember that the creation story is not there just for us, but for our predecessors as well.
* God created man and woman in his own image (and presumably this doesn't mean physical image, although this is not made explicit). There is a link between what we are, and what God is.
* God gave the world to us.
* We are to keep the seventh day holy as a day of rest in order to commemorate his creation. Yes, I know we no longer do this, but I'm only talking about what this passage says.
* We sin by disobeying God, and are separated from God by our sin."

Of course if you want to be technical, you could say that those are the same thing. There's no reason at all to think that purpose being existentially created by where you as part of a system happen to be makes it any less meaningful.

Also at the time, she was on the pill, and occasionally we would have sex without condoms and I would finish inside of her. Usually afterwords we would take turns using the rest room, cleaning up/ cleaning ourselves out.  

Well one time apparently we forgot to do that after sex without a condom, and after a bried break period, we were at it again.

GaProgMan,AskReddit,1389959339.0,"At a school I used to work for (in the UK), the entire staff were told that they would be taking exams alongside students. You teach Science?

The idea was that the staff were all degree educated, so it wouldn't be that difficult for them to learn a new subject - one that it was presumed they would already know the ground work for anyway). Plus it would have a handy side affect of raising test scores for a few years.

THEN some genius decided that, in the 3 years leading up to exam time, all students would take their exams 3 times a year. Even if the students hadn't learnt what was required to take the exams. The idea was that for every year, the number of exam results (good or bad) would be raised by a factor of 9, ""and the law of averages says that we'd have more good results than bad""...

mellvins059,soccer,1389959395.0,I'm not implying that he is a poacher like Chicharito but the way he contributes to an attack is by pushing the defensive line and opening up the final third for his team before finishing off attacks. He is not the sort of forward who will drift into midfield to get the ball. I'm not saying this in a negative way as some systems are designed like this and the right sort of forward in such a system will benefit greatly. These sort of forwards will struggle the most though from a lack of good delivery as they are not like Suarez who will create opportunities through dropping off and taking on players.

It's a ton of fun to just go out to a range, or an open field, WHERE IT'S SAFE, and shoot some stuff.  As long as you're responsible and  halfway intelligent person, you can have fun and do great things with guns.  But like any weapon or tool, it has it's downsides."

Yes, this is still a thing. I think people can hunt (deer, small game, etc) in Michigan as young as 12. They don't need a license at that age I believe *if they are hunting with someone older with a license*. 
But they do need to pass a hunter safety course and have the certificate on them while hunting. Minors (under age 18) must be accompanied by an adult while hunting. 


It was very rare for someone to use a gun in a robbery. Robberies were just plain rare up there anyway. The people that got shot were almost always hunters who got shot from another drunk hunter. (Mom worked in the ER for a while.)

The vast majority of accidents and injuries that ended up in the ER were from drunk people who were from out of town. The locals dumb enough to mix alcohol and snowmobiles killed themselves long ago.

The battery life was always phenomenal to me, it would last a full 5 hours(of full gameplay, throw that 3 hours number out the window) of play from a full charge. i would charge it each night when i was using it and just use it all day. 

it also could be paused midgame (so long as offline) at any time and you could literally leave it paused for a week if you dont let it run flat out of power.  

as far as buying it or waiting, lets look at how many DS's there are compared to psp/psvita. 
tl:dr theres a lot. you dont want to wait for the next vita because there wont be one until the current one is almost completely useless for next-gen consoles(which it wont be, any tech-guru will tell you how its more powerful than most iphones). 

storage space is my biggest problem. i like having my games on the device but in honesty, ill only ever want to install one-two games at a time that i use on my 8gb card. if you shell out now on a 16gb card it can be worth it in the long run but for 32gb cards i would wait for them to drop in price or for a deal OR until you see more games released. you really wont be playing every game you own all the time, unless your the perfect gamer. 

P.S. buy a good case. whether its small or a mini-carrier bag size case, get one. even a plastic cover case, just get one. if theres a deal for one, look at it seriously because a scratched up vita doesnt look as sexy :c

Shows that I'm iffy about including here are School Days and White Album.

BandBoots,asexuality,1389960403.0,"Yo, 22M here, former ace. I have a genetic predisposition for severe depression, and that suppressed my hormones causing me to not experience sexual attraction. For a very long time I identified as asexual, and I no longer do because I got on antidepressants and went all sexy.

Anyone in this sub can tell you that what you feel is the general feeling of asexuality. Not all asexuals are disgusted by the thought of sex, and that may be something that you eventually grow out of, but if you don't have the attraction you don't have the attraction. As for finding a partner, there are several routes. One thing you can do is seek out other asexuals to have relationships with. I think it would be great if the black ring on the right middle finger became more popular in the ace community. I don't think I've ever met another legitimate ace in person, but since I don't ask everyone about their sexuality I can't be sure. Also, I guarantee that there are sexuals that are okay with dating (or even marrying) asexuals. It can be tough for them, and other people might give you grief about it, but if the romantic feelings are there you can make it work. Some people might disagree with me on this, but i would say that if you find someone you like enough, that really likes you, you might want to find some compromise. For your benefit sex wouldn't be especially common, but for their benefit you could toss them one every now and then. You really shouldn't worry about it too much. Even now that I have a sex drive I'm not sexually active at 22, so you should have no problem being 16 and asexual. Just clearly establish it with the guys you date.

Also, having a sex drive is overrated.Truly asexual or not, be proud of whatever you are."

Sir_Fancy_Pants,MuayThai,1389961534.0,"some say ""good fighters cant be made, they are born.""

to be a decent fighter you need what is called ""the seed of meanness""

Its the same thing that makes you capitalise on your opponents misfortune.

In the real world outside of combat the world operates by people trying to as fair and as reasonable as possible, if someone trips or falls, you want to help them up and come to their aid.

In the Ring if someone trips and falls (In MMA for example), your primary response should be ""I could really hurt him now"" 

You cant fight who you are, and any gain in the ring will be at the expense of your ""Professional life""

There is a genuine reason why combat sports attract a certain type of person and demographic.

If you have been conditioned by society and life to be a ""Team player"" with a strong sense of empathy and who looks after and is responsible for others you cant simply switch this off in the ring.

Dont forget if you met your opponent in a pub and talked to him you would probably be more likely to be friends than anyone else, as you both train in thai boxing and have this great shared common passion, its very hard to turn on the ""Now you must be destroyed"" simply because that is the aim of the task.

JaminSousaphone,conspiracy,1389961568.0,"Can I just say to everyone who is stating ""The cop should've could've would've done this blah blah blah""

Regardless of the biased opinion towards police officers (especially american officers as this seems to be predominantly USA subreddit) this police officer did nothing wrong.

As a police officer, [im not a police officer, I mean put yourself in the mindset of one] if someone is coming at you with a knife, showing signs of mental instability or simply intoxication, you are not going to second guess a man you've never met who has a knife. As a police officer he was the only person in that house therefore the only person who was going to get hurt would be him, he had a civilian who called in on the porch who he would probably want to protect. Put yourself in his shoes, it's not about going round there with a taser because when the call would've come in and as soon as he spoke to the woman (partner I assume) she informed him he was armed. WOULD YOU CONFRONT AN ARMED MAN WITH A TASER?! no you fucking wouldn't so shut up and stop using this as an excuse to feed on your hatred for the police. I hate authority (government) just as much as the rest of you but you HAVE to have some respect for officers who do their job accordingly. 
He didn't forcably enter he followed everything by the book and by stating ""why was he in there alone"" he wasn't by the looks of things the other officers were around the house scouting it out. 

This is not a case of police brutatlity. This could have been avoided but chances are it would have resulted in an officer in the hospital with knife wounds. 

That officer would've been branded a coward so would the police force if he ran away and continued to back off. I don't know about you lot but as much as I don't want to see military police on the streets I sure as hell (if I lived in the USA) wouldn't want to see an armed police man running from a guy with a fucking knife!

ep0k,starbound,1389961592.0,"It's pretty easy to mod your starting treasure pool (what's present in the ship locker when you create a new character) to include pretty much anything you want.

If you go to Starbound/assets/ships/(your race) and open ""dropship.structure"" you'll see a block that looks like this:

     {
      ""value"" : [0, 255, 0, 255],
      ""foregroundBlock"" : false,
      ""backgroundBlock"" : true,
      ""backgroundMat"" : ""apexshipwall"",
      ""object"" : ""apexshiplocker"",
      ""objectParameters"" : {
        ""treasurePools"" : [ ""humanStarterTreasure"" ],
        ""level"" : 1,
        ""unbreakable"" : true
      }
    },

That line with ""humanStarterTreasure"" references another file in Starbound/assets/treasure called ""default.treasurepools""

What you can do is change ""humanStarterTreasure"" (or whatever race you're playing) to a new treasure pool like ""bonusStarterTreasure"" and then add that to default.treasurepools. Here's the default human treasure pool:

    ""humanStarterTreasure"" : [
    [0, {
        ""fill"" : [
          ""beamaxe"",
          ""flashlight"",
          [ ""torch"", 10],
          [ ""cornseed"", 3],
          [ ""wheatseed"", 3],
          [ ""humanstarter"", 1]
        ],
        ""levelVariance"" : [0, 0],
        ""allowDuplication"" : false
      } ]
  ],

You can change this to basically anything you want. For example, to start with a diamond drill, nanowrap bandages, burgers, a grappling hook and some other goodies, it would look like this:

    ""bonusStarterTreasure"" : [
    [0, {
        ""fill"" : [
          ""beamaxe"",
          ""flashlight"",
          ""steelbow"",
          ""diamonddrill"",
          ""grapplinghook"",
          [ ""nanowrap"", 100],
          [ ""burger"", 100],
          [ ""alienmeat"", 100],
          [ ""torch"", 100],
          [ ""cornseed"", 10],
          [ ""tomatoseed"", 10],
          [ ""potatoseed"", 10],
          [ ""grapesseed"", 10],
          [ ""wheatseed"", 100],
          [ ""plutoniumore"", 1000],
          [ ""steelplatform"", 1000]
        ],
        ""levelVariance"" : [0, 0],
        ""allowDuplication"" : false
      } ]
  ],

You could also just insert the extra lines into ""humanStarterTreasure"" and not edit dropship.structure at all.

bunker_man,Catholicism,1389961759.0,"&gt;  You can't legislate morals.

Yes you can. If someone thinks otherwise, it means they have a very bizarre definition of morals that essentially means that whatever they think is moral is so necessary that it is absolute in a way that it somehow transcends morals and becomes something higher that has a different name, despite still being morals. Drinking and age of consent laws are legislating morals. Discrimination laws are morals. Regulation laws are morals. economic ideals are morals. Even speed limits are based on a moral philosophy of comparing you forcing an ideal of how much of people's time are worth reducing risks.

In fact, if you want to be technical, you could say that almost ALL legislation is legislating morals. When people say you can't legislate morals, it has almost no meaning. It is effectively a word salad that is an attempt to arbitrarily create a distinction where there is not one in the hopes that most people will not be smart enough to realize that's what happened. 

The argument that some moral issues cannot be resolved by attempting to legislate them is different. And undoubtedly true. But it's important to accurately convey what is being said without trying to be deceptive."

Furthermore, I would not have read *any* of my favourite authors without having the ability to do so with no risk at a library. When I become familiar with their works, the risk goes down, and the chance of me purchasing a physical copy of the book goes up. This, too, puts money in publishers pockets.

I would read fewer books, talk about fewer books, know about fewer books, and pay for fewer books if libraries didn't exist.

But I don't know if that's really your argument. You seem to agree that libraries are good, but argue that they would meet resistance.

Hmm.

It's hard to change a view like that. *Everything* is met with resistance. There are lobbyists out there 'resisting' climate change and global warming, and I can't really argue that there aren't. If public libraries didn't exist, privatized ones probably would, so there would already be some kind of rental/member system in place, and the resistance would most likely argue that the systems are already in place and that we don't need government in on it.

If your view is that piracy is ultimately bad for all involved, try a 'change my view' on that topic, and I'd be happy to give it a try."

Where will all this money come from? If you tax corporations, they'll move their operations to a country with lower taxes. If you tax the super-rich, they'll move their assets elsewhere. I guess you could simply print more money, driving up inflation and continually reducing the purchasing power of the super-rich... Would hyper-inflation still be a bad thing in this situation?

Those two lifestyle choices are completely in opposition to each other, there's no way either of us would be happy. 

And wtf asking a girl out or wanting to date her does NOT make you seem ""weak"" or undesirable. The way you've phrased it makes it sound like you think that expressing interest in dating one girl means that you're settling for her when you'd rather have better women but she's the best you can do. That's actually kind of an offensive way to think, and I'm pretty sure most women who aren't utterly self-loathing would not think that.

Also, you should probably not be listening to the PUA types or the guys who try to use evopsych to ""prove"" anything about romantic/sexual relationships unless you're interested solely in meaningless ONS with women who probably don't have the highest of self-esteem.

Some beers are also packaged with live yeast cultures, either from primary fermentation or added during packaging, to facilitate conditioning in storage.

kratistos,AskReddit,1389962581.0,"**Germany**

* We don't shout a lot. Actually, we perceive Americans as pretty loud. The perception of German as an aggressive-shouting language is rooted in old resentments, not in facts.

* ""Don't mention the war"" - heavily depends on the crowd you're with. Hitler dominates our comedy (which is criticized by some as making him to trivial) and especially with younger Germans you might find many who make a lot of Nazi jokes.

* Oktoberfest. It's a Bavarian thing, mostly visited by Japanese, Italians and Americans. Especially in the North, people don't really care about it.

* ""German Angst"" - the fear of being turned into a Were-Nazi by displaying any kind of national pride. It's kinda a stereotype of Germans in Germany itself, really. But imo now it has been replaced by ""Party patriotism"" - to certain, mostly soccer related event, everybody gets their shitty little flag, shirts and hats and goes full Deutschland for a week. Than we discuss in the papers if really enough Turkish immigrants displayed German flags and how much of a problem it is when they prefer the Turkish ones. After that we go back to our normal selves. Another side of our new patriotism is a certain arrogant ""Am deutschen Wesen soll die Welt genesen"" attitude (The German character shall heal the world). If only the USA were as peaceful as we are. If only the Russians were as liberal. If only the Greek/Italians/Spainish were as effective, orderly and hard working as we are - we'd live in a Utopia. Backdoor nationalism, in the end.

* Racism/antisemitism are totally unacceptable here (which I hear on reddit quite often): Don't delude yourself. It's there. Not as bad as in East Europe, but it's there. I don't know about the racism thing but there's certainly more antisemitism here than in the US.

* Our porn preferences are fucked up. Seriously, we seem to export all that - at least the people I know are very normal, porn wise.

* Trains being on time because we are so well organized. Fuck that. That's the first winter in years in which our train system doesn't collapse and only because we didn't have any snow yet.

Here are the true ones:

* Pork &amp; Beer ftw
* We are the white people of white people when it comes to dancing
* Our comedy is the worst.
* Our language has a lot of beautiful, often melancholic and unique words, like Wanderlust (The almost sexual urge to hike), Fernweh (Far away sickness, the opposite of being homesick), Bergentrückung (The believe of a King not dieing but instead being taken deep into a mountain where he waits for his time to comeback in the moment of deepest despair) or Waldeinsamkeit (spiritual loneliness in the forest)

SirJefferE,changemyview,1389962722.0,"&gt;Perhaps the biggest is the ease with which CDs can be copied.

I disagree.

This is not the biggest difference, and it has spawned a pretty big side discussion on the comparative difficulties of copying books and cds.

The biggest difference is the *need* to copy. Even if the difficulties of copying a music cd or a book were absolutely identical, and both took seconds, I believe music cd's would be more copied than books. I read most books once; after that, I have no problems returning them to the library. If they were really good, I might check them out again a few years down the line. If they are *really* good I might buy them, despite having already read them. There are only a dozen or so books I have read three or more times in my life, and there's just too many books out there to add many to that list.

Music is consumed differently, you repeat songs, you repeat artists, you put together playlists, you think ""What was that song I was obsessed with in the summer of 2011?"" You put different music on while studying, different music while gaming, you shape your tastes almost daily on what type of music you like, and you build libraries based on that.

Music is something people have a desire to *own* and renting it from a library just isn't the same thing. *That* is why music is copied so much more than books.

But as a side note, I've copied tons of music in my life, and I wouldn't even know where to begin to copy a book, so there is a small degree of difficulty involved."

There is definitely a lot of end game content to do.

If you're having trouble finding people to talk to, we have have an in-game chat bot for us redditors. It's a start and maybe you find a good org through one of the members on the bot.

As for finding teams, it's not too difficult. You just use the LFT tool or subscribe to the broadcast bots (see sidebar for neutnet/dnet bots) and they're constantly advertising for people to do missions and questing with.

The last thing I'll throw in is that ever since the merge of both server into one server, the population seems more fluid than before. You see lots of people hanging out in Borealis, OA and Rome. Once you find a few people in game to do stuff with, add them to your buddy list and msg them later to see if they want to do anything. I've made a lot of non-org friends that invite me to do things around the game.

You can always make a froob account and run around for a bit and see how it looks. Sit in OOC and chat with people, join Snoonet and chat with us, etc. It's free and gives you an idea of what the game looks and feels like at this point. Making a toon to level 20 and going to ToTW is super easy.

Twerkstar1,explainlikeimfive,1389963938.0,"Taken from another post by /u/Teotwawki69

Well, Euler was a very famous mathematician, born in 1707, and...

Oh, wait. The other Euler's Identity! This video explains it simply and well. You should watch the whole thing, but if you want the bit that explains Euler's Identity, skip to 6 minutes.

The importance of Euler's Identity is that it proved that Pi is a transcendental number, and not algebraic. An algebraic number is any number that can be reduced to zero using only whole numbers and addition, subtraction, multiplication, or raising to a power. Transcendental numbers cannot be reduced this way.

For example, 10 reduces to zero as 10 - 10 = 0. The square root of negative 1 (or i) reduces as i2 +1 = 0. Etc. The video explains this perfectly, although the one thing they don't mention is what the number ""e"" is.

The number e is a constant that's the base of natural logarithms, and is equal to approximately 2.7183 -- but approximately in the same way that Pi is approximately 3.14159. e was proven to be transcendental a long time ago.

Although Pi had been around for two thousand years, it was Euler and his identity which proved that Pi was also transcendental. It was long known to be irrational, but irrational numbers are algebraic. Euler's identity basically proved without calculating out the entire number that Pi was transcendental, meaning that its digits would go on without ever repeating forever. (Note that i was already shown to be algebraic, so by process of elimination it proved that Pi was not algebraic.)

And, by the way, the e in the number e got there because... it was Euler's last initial. e is also known as Euler's Number.

Bonus points. The five most important numbers in mathematics are e, 0, 1, Pi and i. Euler's identity uses all five of them.

That said, the rest of the poem falls flat. The structure and form is amateur, with little attention paid to rhythmic pattern. The wordplay is child-like and simplistic; indeed, poetry isn't all about clever linguistic tricks and all that, but in your text I feel it acts as more of a hindrance than anything else. 

It was fairly uncomfortable to recite because you give the reader no 'guidance' in your prose. At the moment, it comes across as 'Russell Brand-style' social rambling; you clearly have good intentions and at least decent ideas but you put it across using generic imagery (a butcher eating human meat is an overused trope) and pay little attention to the flow of your text.

Knowing that might go a long way towards helping. Also take a few minutes to look at your ultrasounds and look for ""you"" characteristics

My MIL insited that our baby had ""his dad's nose"" at 10 weeks. 10 weeks. She also insisted that she could tell that turtle was a girl b/c she worked in L&amp;D, again at 10 FREAKING WEEKS, when the genitals aren't even FREAKING FORMED!!

Wall of text, sorry.

As someone who has Mathematics teaching experience, I can say (knowing that you already know this) the following:

&gt; If a student doesn't want to learn something, there is no way to MAKE them learn.

That is the biggest pill that school legislature has to swallow. You can give a school millions in a budget, you can get local businesses, celebrities and sports stars involved, hell you can even give the kids incentive through gifts (something I have seen, first hand, at the schools where I used to work), but if a student doesn't want to learn, then they wont.

I once saw a student who had behavioural issues sitting an exam with a TA. The TS was trying to convince this student to ""at least try the exam."" The student (who would have been 16), was sitting with their arms crossed, having a tantrum because she was being asked to take the exam.

Here's where it gets real interesting: I was invigilating the exam, so on top of watching for cheaters, playing invigilator Pacman (before the exam starts, you all decide who is going to be Pacman and who are the ghosts. The entire exam is spent walking round, avoiding contact with Pacman), and keeping an eye on this student. with 20 minutes to go, the TA reaches over, takes the pen from the student and starts to take the exam. She starts answering the questions for this girl.

Here in the UK, we have a bunch of exams that are taken at the end of High School called the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), ALL students take them. They are graded from A* (the best, 95-100% correct) through to F (failure, 20-0% correct), and all the way down to X (didn't even put their name on the paper).

This student refused to even put her name on the paper, but left with a high E (borderline low D) grade because a TA took the exam for her."

buildmeupbreakmedown,DebateAChristian,1389964620.0,"You can't fear on command either. Emotions aren't subjected to will. Everything I said about the first commandment applies to your quote from Luke 12 as well.

Now, since it is impossible to will yourself into a specific emotion (love, fear, anger, gratitude, whatever), what conclusion can we draw from the fact that God apparently demands that people do exactly that? There's only two possibilities: either he legitimately wants people to do the impossible, or he only wants people to *think* that's what he wants. In the first case, he'd be misguided. And since he's God, that's obviously off the table. So the only answer that makes sense is the second one: *God is playing a trick on us*. He wants us to try doing the impossible and learn from the experience. Those of us who can see the through trick learn the same lesson without the mental suffering and guilt associated with the attempt. Either way, it brings our consciousness closer to Him.
If you disagree, I'd like to know why. I assume you don't have a problem with my premise that humans cannot control our emtions through mere willpower, so what do you make of it when God demands that we do, knowing that he's also the one who made it impossible?

* How would these gore-splattered relatives even know whether the bomb came from a plane or a drone? These things are fired from miles away.

* Even if they could tell, why would their anger not just turn towards the drone operator? If you seriously think that when it's a plane they hate the pilot instead of America (hint: they hate both) why wouldn't they hate the drone operator?

&gt; Also, the drone won't feel remorse over killing innocent civilians, though a pilot might and maybe he could actually do the right thing and not listen to the commander in chief calling the shots and approving drone strikes (Obama).

* Again, drones are operated and controlled by people. If a pilot can feel remorse and disobey orders, so can a drone operator.

* Your country has already shown how it feels about people who disobey orders based on what they consider to be doing the right thing. Look at Snowden to see how well that goes for them.

* If you found a pilot willing to follow the order to bomb an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, a guaranteed civilian target, I can't imagine your pilots will wrestle with orders to drop much, much smaller bombs against targets they believe are legitimate. 

* Incidentally, does this mean FDR was a bomber? Does Dubya's deployment of air firepower in Iraq and Afghanistan make him a bomber? Or does it somehow only apply when they use drones (an utterly ludicrous distinction)?"

He also took part in battles that prevented Israel from being overrun and destroyed, while multiple countries were declaring war and invading.  He fought like a lion when the countries back was against the wall.

&gt; Assigned a defensive role in the 1967 Six-Day War, Sharon, in command of the most powerful armored division on the Sinai front, instead drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's brigade faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area.[12]
&gt; Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the Battle of Abu-Ageila led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a new paradigm in operational command. Researchers at the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering each other as they were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.[29]
&gt; In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's Southern Command. He had no further promotions before retiring in August 1973. Soon after, he helped found the Likud (""Unity"") political party.[30]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Operation Gazelle, Israel's ground maneuver, encircles the Egyptian Third Army, October 1973
&gt; At the start of the Yom Kippur War on October 6, 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his assigned reserve armored division. On his farm, before he left for the front line, the Reserve Commander, Zeev Amit, said to him, ""How are we going to get out of this?"" Sharon replied, ""You don't know? We will cross the Suez Canal and the war will end over there."" Sharon arrived at the front, to participate in his fourth war, in a civilian car.[31] His forces did not engage the Egyptian Army immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness, Sharon's forces moved to a point on the Suez Canal that had been prepared before the war. In a move that again thwarted the commands of his superiors, Sharon's division crossed the Suez, effectively winning the war for Israel.[12] He then headed north towards Ismailia, intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the Fresh Water Canal.[32]"

Goitein pointed to other laws that can and have been brought to bear, including Section 641 of Title 18 in the U.S. Code. It prohibits theft of government property. It was used in 2002 against a Drug Enforcement Agency official who gave sensitive, not classified, information to a London newspaper.

1. Make a point to try to use your hips when you walk. Girls sway their hips a bit when they walk (generally), and it makes you look more feminine.

2. When standing, alternate between leaning on one leg and also putting your hands on your hips.

3. Use a lot of one-finger pointing gestures when speaking, but use it in the way that it's like ""nuh-uh-uh!""

4. Stand so that your chest pokes out. Everyone's body is different, so this is difficult to explain.

5. Use a lot of smiling and a lot of blinking to your advantage.

I told them I had just had surgery and was physically not able to do so, so they told me I couldn't get on my flight.

If you're interested in doing a kink/fetish style for your shows, advertise it in your profile. Take pics of yourself with some of your gear, use keywords/tags, etc. In my experience, guys will come in to your room asking for VERY specific things. If you have them or can improvise something on the spot, you're good. The more toys, gear, clothes, costumes, etc that you have, the better off you'll be. 

Everyone develops their own camming style, but in my experience it's worked best to be open to anything that doesn't harm me (psychologically or physically). Most of my customers are subs, and I think that's true for most cam sites. There are a few doms out there, and they are very happy to spend money, too. They're just few and far between. 

As for your looks/fitness level, I don't think it matters all that much. Your hustle is what's really important. There is a customer and a site for everyone. It's just a matter of experimenting with different sites until you find the best fit for you. I would recommend starting on at least two different sites  - one that's token/tip based and one that's private based. Sign up for as many sites as you can - it's always good to have plenty of back-up options.

The best safety advice is to keep your work and private life completely separate. Don't tell anyone your real name or location. Turn off location services for your camera so people can't track you from pics you post. Don't talk about anything extremely specific regarding local news/weather/etc. NO PAYPAL. Always get money up front before doing *anything* for a customer - scammers are all over and they love to prey on new models. "

He didn't really intend for anyone other than a few of his friends to actually see it, but this is the Internet we're talking about. Someone changed the file name from ""bustaknut"" to ""college girl gets fucked"" and then to ""priceless"". A few months later, it was something like the 8th most downloaded video on napster.

She sued him, won, and I think he's still paying it off. He was high school senior when it started.

When something moves in a straight line in a certain direction, momentum keeps it moving in that direction unless some force is applied to it. You see this phenomenon everywhere and you should be familiar with it. 

Similarly, when something is spinning around an axis, momentum keeps it spinning round that axis. The faster the spin, the more force it takes to change the axis. Gyroscope spin very fast, so it takes a very big force to change its axis of rotation, just like it would take a very big force to stop a fast moving object.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,gifs,1389965407.0,"Am I the only one to point out this ""Test"" is utter bullshit.

One could easily make a car massively unsafe and more lethal than the 1959 car and in such a test it would appear to be the safer, as it uses the 1959 car as its crumple zone and is a rigid body (something that is massively unsafe)

two identical 1959 cars, or two identical 2009 cars would be better, but a stationary concrete block is even better (but its a different test) to compare the two.

it looks good, but don't go reading anything into it

Edit: Holy shit, physicists, engineers,  and people who have graduated school check out the replies its hilarious, people cant understand how crashing two differently composed engineered structures is not as valid as subjecting those two bodies, to equal forces by way of a carefully controlled and consistent 3rd body (concrete block). and also how crashing the two bodies against each other is an extension of violating this scientific principle.

lunarbizarro,asktransgender,1389965413.0,"""Would you still see yourself as trans? Or would trans be an affliction you are waiting to treat, like a cleft pallet, or a double mastectomy?""

I probably have a bit of a radical view in the community in that I don't self-identify. I only really assign labels to myself that other people assign for me. I'm a woman because people call me a woman, and I'm trans because people call me trans when they find out I've transitioned. I guess there could be different words for that in the future? But I don't really assign identities to myself that others don't assign for me. 


""I guess I am asking, to you, does transgenderism define who you are, or what you have suffered from society? And how much less traumatic do you think it will be to some future transgendered person if such a level of acceptance existed?""

I think being transgender only defines as much weight as other people put on it. I changed my body from a male-appearing body to a female-appearing body. It's a thing I did, the labels that are put on it are inconsequential to me. In a post-gender society, I think the experiences of a trans person would be externally easier (as gender presentation would be largely irrelevant), but internal angst would be just as hard. I'm generally seen as a woman by society and not harassed for my choice of clothes, yet I still internally feel that my body is too male-appearing, and I have two surgeries in the future to correct that. Society isn't the problem in my day-to-day experiences, my body is. 

Edit: based on my post-gender opinions, you might assume that I'm some constant genderfucker or something. I'm not. I'm a feminine person who does feminine-coded things, with a handful of masculine-coded things. I think the idea that trans people should be held to a higher standard of genderfuckery in a gendered society than cis people or else we're playing on sexist stereotypes is kind of absurd. If cis women are allowed to be feminine while being feminist, then I'm allowed to do that. "

The_Y0ung_Wolf,AskReddit,1389965771.0,"Alright, so I have ulcerative colitis and regularly had to have colonoscopies/sigmoidoscopies before I had my colectomy and whilst I had my ileostomy. I had a routine flexi-sig scheduled for one morning, but unfortunately it was the same day as a leadership program at my school that I really wanted to attend because I was a prefect. I decided the best thing to do would be to undergo my sigmoidoscopy without anesthesia, because I would be able to recover faster and get to school for the majority of the day. 

It was by far the most uncomfortable twenty minutes of my life; I constantly and simultaneously felt like I needed to take a massive shit and like my bowels were going to be ruptured by the pressure. I have been through a lot of pain because of my disease and the multiple surgeries, but none of it compares to the discomfort I experienced that morning. That was only the beginning though...

I was able to make it to school for the start of the leadership day and I found it very interesting and quite fun. It was at the end of the day, when we were playing a warm down exercise, that I was accidentally bumped into by another student. It hurt a lot more than it should of, but I had only recently had my surgery so I didn't think much of it. It was about an hour later when I arrived home that I decided to check my stoma. Boy did I get a shock. It turns out that when I had been bumped, the impact had forced my intestine to shift causing about 10 cm of my small intestine to prolapse out of my ileostomy! 

Naturally I freaked the fuck out, as one is expected to when they see their guts hanging out of their body. Luckily my aunt is a nurse and she talked my mum and I through the technique of pushing the intestine back through the stoma, but it took about an hour and a half! That is the story of the worst day of my life.

TL;DR had a long tube shoved up my butt without anesthetic and had to push my guts back into my body. "
Wiltron,AskReddit,1389965776.0,"I was a bouncer for 12 years at various bars in and around the Toronto area (comment history if you need proof, a few times I've mentioned it).

Most memorable was when I was working a bar/club called Guvernment, a bar known for having significant crime, date-rape and even shootings. Well, I'm working door checking IDs with my partner Shawn, there's a lineup ~40 people long, when a group of 3 guys come up and try to walk right past us. Myself being a relatively average height but generally scary looking individual, and Shawn, a 6'4"" 400lbs football QB, they literally bounced off of us and then tried again to just push their way through.

We said that the lineup starts down there (pointing to the end of the line), when 5'4"" 120lbs ""gangsta"" says ""naa man I'm clubbin now"" or some general uneducated riffraff. He tried a third time but Shawn wasn't having any of it. He picks up the guy over his head and throws him 3 car lengths away, landing in a snow bank. His two friends with him go rushing over to see if he's ok. Well, not even 30 seconds go by and I hear POP as a .22 (found out that after the fact) fires off and his Shawn directly in center mass chest, heart area. Shawn goes running after the guy and just jumps on top of him, belly flopping and crushing a few of his ribs, breaking the guys forearm and dislocating his other shoulder (he tried to stop Shawn with both arms extended outwards).

Little did I know Shawn was wearing a vest, which saved his life, and his quick reaction saved my life as I'm sure he was going to fire off towards me next.

The other two guys were detained by a few off duty firefighters in the line, while the main shooter was taken away in cuffs in an ambulance. Needless to say the two firefighters and their entire group drank free that night.

I did manage to accidentally walk into a Main Conference talk though on Deux Ex: Human Revolution, and saw that those talks are some of what I was missing by not buying a MC pass. 

The next year I went for a Main Conference pass. Lots of interesting material, it was still ""worth it"", but I was so fricking tired. I felt like I had to go to as many talks as possible to get my money's worth (it's a considerable amount of money to pay!), but I just ended up so exhausted and didn't go to anything on the last day. It was still ""worth it"" for me because I went to a talk by Blizzard about their build systems and it was extremely interesting and relevant to my work.

This year I'm going to go for the Expo pass. The talks are interesting, but I can easily see them if I want to in the Vault. I've always treated GDC as more of a ""holiday"" where I can also catch up with friends from other countries etc who all flock to the venue. This year I'm going to focus on that part of it instead of tiring myself out with talks and lectures. So for me at this stage buying anything more expensive would not be worth it.

I obviously don't need these in a partner because personality goes a long way, and with a partner, I'm really just looking for someone who's in decent shape with a pretty/cute face.  But anyway, to the body types...

* Hardbodies - this is one that I just recently started really becoming attracted to.  

* Athletic -  anyone pretty into fitness, such as running, lifting, dancing, etc.  By athletic, I suppose I mean similar to the hardbody but a *little* softer (although by definition, hardbody is technically a subset of athletic).  Abs are less likely to be visible, but there's probably still some sort of definition in the abdominal area (so I guess, lines showing, but no visible 6 pack).  I suppose the best term for the body might be ""tight.""

* Petite - typically short (but not necessarily, although usually not tall for this category), thin, but still having some sort of curves (they don't have to be extreme, just not straight sided).  And man, /r/bustypetite, damn.

Basically, squatter's legs are one of my favorite things. Both a large and small chest can be incredibly attractive in their own way - I suppose it depends on the body that they're on.  I prefer a narrower waist at least when we're talking about looking at a woman straight on.  I just like to see at least somewhat of an hourglass figure - if abs are worked too much, the waist will go straight into the hips instead of going outward at the hips.  

As for the face, I have no idea how to do that one.  There's nothing specific I can really point out, because there are certain features that look amazing on one person but terrible on another, so I can't really say.  But I like a face that isn't boring and plain I suppose?  That's the best way I can describe it.  If they smile, I want to see something like cute or sexy, not ""plain.""

As for ethnicity, anything goes.  Although, and I hope this makes sense...if you took 3 women, one Latin, one Asian, and one of anything else, and they were all ""objectively"" the same attractiveness to someone completely unbiased, I would likely rate the Latin and Asian women slightly higher.

ice_candle,AskMen,1389966037.0,"The fact that it is in the constitution is irrelevant to this discussion, I think. If you were to disregard the historical allowance of gun ownership in the US, what would your views be?

I know that you go on to answer this, but when people use the constitution as an argument for gun ownership it really bugs me. Constitutions can and should change to reflect the times - put to a public vote where more than a simple majority would have to accept. 

2 - You don't need guns for self defence. The best defence is prophylactic: remove the possibility of being in the situation. You also can't defend against what you can't predict. Maybe that is a weak argument but I've been in a few fights and have never felt the need to escalate my own personal protection.

3 - I probably agree with you here, though concealed carry actually goes beyond what law enforcement is allowed.

4 - An individual doesn't need a gun for this. Licensed businesses / premises would be sufficient. I think that you should be licensed to hunt, in which case you would also gain a license for a rifle / shotgun; this way the fauna can be kept in check responsibly.

5 - You admit that it would reduce violent crime. If only by the smallest measure then in my opinion it would be worth it. It would also restrict the ease that gangs could get access to guns, thereby reducing violent crime further (though there would need to be some kind of mass confiscation of guns if this were to applied in the US, owing the huge number already in circulation).

Rhetoric - you don't need a gun to face your fears or mean people.

British, by the way, clearly not in favour of gun ownership by the general populace. Through a license system, with thorough background checks and clearly stated need, I am fine with individuals owning guns. I don't believe that anybody has the *fundamental right* to own something that's sole purpose is to cause death."

Giamitti's role, for example, was great. It was well-acted and he fit the role well. However, he's only in the film for two different scenes. So you sort of expect him to play a role, but by the time you realize that he will no longer be in the film you're wondering what purpose did he serve in the film besides dragging you out of the film and distracting you from the story. It ruins the immersion which is bad for a film that's trying to keep you invested in the tragedy of this man's life.

evilbrent,careerguidance,1389966189.0,"Personally I prefer to look at birds in my hand.

Do you have real estate skills? Yes the ceiling for real estate income is quite high, but the basement is very low. Some of them make all their money in three or four sales a year and just live on hope and fond wishes the rest of their life. Fine if you've got a hundred grand in savings, not so fine if you're used to a regular income. But for me, personally, every single time I've heard the word 'commission' I think stress. I think heart ache. I think people working long hours with little reward except for maybe one time in twenty it pays off and they hit it big. Same as when I hear ""if I work hard"". That's code for ""put in the hours"". Which is code for ""You don't want to be a part of your family do you?""

I think that both of your choices increase your financial security, and I think that money isn't REALLY an issue for you in that you pay your bills and drive a nice-ish car and can afford to go on the odd vacation right? I think that one of them is just a j.o.b. while the other has to be a lifestyle.

Real estate agents get paid a lot because they work 7 days a week, and they regularly work to 10pm. The rest of us go home and get changed and spend that time playing tennis with our friends. Real estate agents HAVE to drive flashy cars, and they HAVE to have the best suits. Gold watch. Even if you're not considering being an agent, everyone in the organisation is under the exact same expectations.

My advice is to thank your friend very sincerely and tell them that a great opportunity has come up in your current job.

Good luck."

tPRoC,malefashionadvice,1389966336.0,"&gt;Personal preference combined with trends absolutely governs acceptable 'fit'. Look at celebrities wearing suits in the 90s compared to now. What you're saying makes no sense. 

What the hell are you even arguing here? That clothing trends change? They obviously do. I also don't value how most celebrities dressed in the 90's, because I think most celebrities still dress terribly- that said, there was nothing wrong with how clothes fit in the 90's. It was just a different aesthetic- people saw something in it that you (and others) probably don't see.

&gt;Most people will look at example 1 at a glance (the way most people will actually see it in real life on the street), and their instant thought will be ""baggy shirt"" or ""13 year old kid"".

Most people will actually not even notice or care. Also, I'd love to see some 13 year old kids who wear oversized, hidden-placket shirts with white boots and blue, stacked pants.

&gt;The unnecessary eccentricity of the shirt fit demands too much attention and distracts from the rest of the ensemble.

The rest of the outfit is just as eccentric. If the shirt were fitted, it would look really awkward in conjunction with those pants. He is obviously going for a relaxed, ""sloppy"" look, so a fitted shirt doesn't even make sense there either.

&gt;You can pull off noticeably 'baggy' items as long as they are offset by appropriately-fitted items, but there are still limitations.

No, there are no hard and fast ""limitations"", everything is contextual.

&gt;Also, you don't know anything about what I like or wear, so cop on. You can't say 'clothing is subjective' and then make a snide remark for me not liking something you like.

I don't. The point of me saying ""I think whatever you like is boring"" was to re-iterate the fact that clothing is subjective, in response to you saying that the picture looks terrible.

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1389966458.0,"&gt;Safer?.

For $10 USD, I purchased a 16 GB USB drive and installed Ubuntu on it.  I disconnected my primary hard drive, booted off the USB stick, and installed my bitcoin wallet.  I then generated an address offline, passphrase protected my wallet offline, and printed the private key (which I modified 5 digits of in a way that only I know), and transferred all my BTC to that new address.  I keep the USB stick and the paper wallet separate.  I am also looking into hiding the paper wallet in a wall in the house.  Since my internet connection was turned off prior to the private key being generated, I see no possible way for a 'hacker' to obtain my private key unless I reboot from USB and connect to the internet.  And even then, the hacker would have had to root Ubuntu with a keylogger/transmitter, and I believe the possibility of that is zero to none.

&gt;Cheaper?

Credit cards charge merchants charge somewhere in the range of 2.75% to 3.5% per transaction:  https://squareup.com/pricing.  Most places charge 1% to convert from BTC to local currency.  So, the next cost is still cheaper with BTC, and will forever be cheaper because there is less risk involved.

&gt;Faster?

Bitcoin-QT wallet will let you know that you have 'unconfirmed' transactions within seconds.  For small purchases, this is completely safe.  For larger purchases, I'd recommend waiting 10 minutes to get several confirmations, which is still plenty fast.  The only vulnerability here is a 51% attack.

I need more information for more in depth commentary, but from a more philosophical standpoint, my guess is that they're not making this offer just to steal your knowledge.  That's not a viable strategy for success, and most companies understand this (e.g. you can't win a marathon by cheating - you can trip some people here and there, but there are too many runners and the race is too long - the only way to win is by genuinely being good at what you do).  If you come on board and you make that company a crap ton of money, they're not going to fire you.  Period.  I'd be more concerned about what happens if you FAIL to meet those objectives, in which case you can generate a lot of bad blood.  My suggestions: read your employment contract, retain a lawyer if you don't understand it (won't be that expensive), and be an optimist.  Good entrepreneurs are always optimists - you have to be willing to put aside your fear and believe that you can make it happen."

Wal\*Mart, etc., cannot afford to devote any space to an $1100 espresso machine.  You could easily replace that item with two $50-$100 coffee machines and sell so many more items that you turn more profit from that physial space.

Just as an aside, this kind of statement can cause a family rift that will last generations in extreme cases. Not everyone can get over the fact that their sibling/family member said something like that about someone they were serious about, and, if the SO knows about it, it can become something that they associate with you and your family forever...even after married, with kids, etc. This has happened in my own extended family and one of my cousins, her husband, and their children do not participate in any family activities because of something that was said about their relationship while they were in high school 20 years ago. People's relationships are very personal and meaningful to them, so things that may not seem that bad to the person saying it may still cause ill-will to linger in the family relationship for a long time.

tPRoC,malefashionadvice,1389966956.0,"&gt;It depends on a lot of variables. But, the fact that there's no best answer doesn't mean that there's no better answers. Black isn't outright wrong, I just don't believe that it bears any strength in itself unless you combine the very few things that go along with it : other neutral tones like white or grey or saturated colors (like full-on red) or an attempt to produce an overall ambiance of darkness/seriousness.

This is not at all unique to black.

&gt;I find the first one magnificent, but not because of the colors. I like it because of the textures and the volumes. Everything moves in it, and it could be one of the very few occasions when it might be better not to go with too much color.

&gt;I don't like the second one, not because I would find it poorly executed (which I don't), but because I don't like the style choice. I think this outfit is okay, but I don't find it particularly good because I doesn't make me feel good. I find it boring yet stylish.

&gt;The third one is just plain banal. Kinda works because of the t-shirt. I don't like his jeans, and I don't like his shoes since you can't see how they look.

&gt;As a side note, I guess that it has to do with where you live too. I live in Paris, half of the time weather's cloudy, so white and black just gets depressing. I feel, and I insist on the verb choice, that colorful choices are more welcoming.

This is all pointless and subjective. It's okay that you have opinions and preferences, but they have absolutely no bearing on the fact that black is just as versatile as most other colours when used correctly.

&gt;Now, like I said, black is properly executed in the examples you gave. I just happen to feel that they would be better with actual colors.

This is again, just subjective. I (And many others, including the wearers) wouldn't like them as much if you changed the colours.

pstanish,FeMRADebates,1389966983.0,"let me start by saying I am happy to hear that your parents are still together. Mine are too, so I watched people around me. It might have been different for that reason too then.

&gt;I internalized that if I were to get married, I better make damn sure I find the right person, but I never thought to myself ""marriage won't work"".

Whereas I never trusted myself to have predictive knowledge of anyone. That might be in part because I did not know couples who inevitably got divorced well enough to notice any animosity. From my POV they looked normal until they weren't.

&gt;I know I was socialized to think that women's lives weren't really complete until they got married. Marriage was brought up to me in a way that was never brought up to my brother.

Maybe it was the micro culture that I lived in (hardcore christian), but marriage has always been something expected of my sister and I. IIRC my mom started crying the first time I asked why marriage was so important, because she thought I never would get married (and still might, who knows). I have friends in this same micro culture who are more interested in marriage than their sisters (different family so poor comparison).

&gt;Whenever I met a woman in her 40's who never got married, I did a bit of a mental-double take.

My uncle never married (until this year, just after he turned 51), He was always a bit of an outcast in the family, though we found out recently that may have been partly because of his long-time partner who hated family altogether. As a kid though, my parents were quick to point out that he was not married when I aced if him and that woman I saw him with were married. My reasoning was that he is old and all the old people that I know are married, so if he isn't there is something defective (it turned out there was, he was with a very caustic woman who never wanted to him to visit and always made power plays to stop him from seeing us, but that's a different topic).

&gt;Nowadays, on an intellectual level, I realize that's her choice, and through feminism I've become a lot better at realizing that some women don't want to get married, and that that's okay.

I will leave you with one question. You used the word intellectual, does that mean your gut reaction is that women should still be married past a certain age?"

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389967021.0,"I don't think you can necessarily ""snap him out"" of anything, because to me, that means he would normally feel a different way, but that doesn't sound like the case.  It sounds like this is just how he wants to be, and how he enjoys being.

I feel like you need to really explain to him how important it is to you that the relationship is moving forward.  The problem is you keep letting him have outs.  You see the relationship as being in trouble, but he doesn't, because you two just have different definitions of what constitutes a good relationship.  He doesn't seem to fully understand yours, which is probably why you think he'd feel blind-sided if you broke up with him right now.

You sort of have to give him an ultimatum, although not formed as an ultimatum, if that makes sense.  I think he has to understand that there are certain things that you *need* out of a relationship, not just that you *want* them.  That's a big difference.  As an example of what I mean, something like ""I love being with you and I want to be with you more than anything.  However, I need to feel that our relationship is moving forward in order to be truly happy.  I'm incredibly happy with you and our relationship, but it can't be stagnant anymore, it needs to move forward.""

If I had to guess, it sounds like he's afraid of bringing on any major changes.  He's comfortable with how things are and doesn't want to screw that up.  I think he needs to understand how both of you and the relationship will benefit by moving it forward.  Explain what it takes to be ready to move forward, and why you think you two are at that point.

GeeJo,Ask_Politics,1389967427.0,"&gt;  If you have a big-ass economy, you're going to have a big-ass military budget. The US is still only ~2% over the NATO target in terms of GDP spent on the military. 

I hear this argument a lot. The normal soundbite from people like Charles Krauthammer is that ""We're spending less money as a percentage of GDP than we were in the 1950s"". Which is true, but misleading. Looking at spending as a percentage of GDP is like a bank approving a home loan based entirely on the applicant's wages - ""You earn $150,000 a year, so of course we'll approve the loan!"" Then the bank gets a nasty shock when it turns out the person has liens on their property, the job looks shaky, and he's got credit card debt up the wazoo.

The reason it made sense to have high spending as a percentage of GDP in the past was that the economic future of the U.S. at the time was bright - manufacturing capitol of the world, leader in every single industry they chose to engage in. If the nation was ever going to start taking on debts to finance its military, the mid-20th century was the ideal time to do it. 

And *at the same time*, the country was engaged in an existential fight for its survival against the Soviet Union. Peace-time drafts, ""duck and cover"" drills and all that. ""Ivan"" was basically the entire reason for setting the 2% GDP goal within NATO. But he's not around any more, and times are not looking as rosy as they were in the immediate post-war period for the U.S. economy. It might well be time to re-examine whether it continues to make sense to maintain that policy.

And you're kind of right in that, for the U.S. military at this point in time to do everything it's expected to, it's probably not receiving enough cash. Budgets are getting increasingly tight and a lot of CENTCOM meetings revolve around trying to do more with less. None of what's going on with military spending is the military's fault - they don't set the goals and they don't set the budget; that's the politicians' jobs. What detractors of the inflated budget are arguing for is for a massive scaling back of operational scope, something that I expect a lot of military folks would be in favor of. It's starting to get too expensive to keep acting as the policeman of the world, to continue to intervene not directly for *U.S.* interests but for *allied* interests in the hopes of reaping benefits down the line. 

Maintain enough of a fleet to keep the shipping lanes safe (since that's one job that *needs* to get done and no-one else seems to want to do it), an army organised with the idea of *defense* rather than power projection, and accept that, maybe, being the lone military superpower just isn't worth the economic cost in increasingly tough times. Britain managed a relatively soft landing from the dismantlement of its empire. It might be worth asking for a few hints on doing the same thing.

**EDIT**: I had a paragraph on the accounting tricks that go into making the Defense budget seem smaller than it actually is, such as shunting away the Nuclear Weapons budget to the Department of Energy, some of the military intelligence budget to other sectors, and spinning off whole areas such as Veteran Affairs that under a rational system would almost certainly be counted under the ""defense budget"". I stripped it out since, in the end, all of that stuff only affects the numbers by a few percentage points relative to overall spending. It's arguing over pennies."

Exis007,Adoption,1389967486.0,"I never understand why people find it cruel to ""kick out"" an eighteen year old kid. The cruel thing, to my mind, is to continue to reinforce the idea that he can behave like this without consequences. 

There is a transition that is happening to him regardless of whether or not he likes it. When you are seven and you don't do your homework, you get in ""trouble"" but the end game is to use it as a teachable moment for responsibility and good choices. When you're 18 and you don't come to work, you are fired. There's a point at which the expectation is that if you don't do x, there will be y consequences. Don't insure your car? You're going to get your car taken away by the police. You're going to be on the hook for huge medical bills in the event of an accident. 

You're a figure of the past system. In the past, he didn't do what he was supposed to and you were there to love and support him through that teachable moment. He is still approaching your home, your money, and your boundaries like a child. He's fighting this central authority figure (his parents) to be able to do what he wants, when he wants to do it. But the trouble with that is that he's going to face a LOT of authority figures and most of them aren't going to kiss his boo-boo's. So, once again, you're going to have to be some of the first people to set the example that he's crossed the line wherein he gets the endless leeway and patience because that's just not the world he lives in anymore. 

**But here's the most important part**: You ARE different. You're not the police or his boss. You are not indifferent to his survival and happiness. You are his source of unconditional love and support, the people who always have his back. But you can't do that job fully, you can't really ""be"" there for him, when you're playing warden and traffic cop and social worker for him because then you're just another authority figure to whom he can give the run around. He needs to develop the gratitude and respect that comes along with an adult relationship with parents who love you a whole lot. What he seems to have right now is a child's relationship to a parent's authority. Freeing both of you from that burden (go to therapy, pay some bills, get your act together!) might very well be the kick in the pants he needs to get to a place where he can appreciate both the love and the practical support (re: a place to live) you can offer. Until he experiences the cold, hard world he's going to have no perspective on the soft, loving alternative you're trying to offer. 

Those struggles? They aren't going away. But you can only meet him half way, right? You can't make him work through his abandonment, his racial identity, or his relationship to his birth mom and sibling. He has to make a choice to face those issues and work through them. You've tried to provide a space to take those on and you've been rebuffed. He's not ready. He's probably not ready to support himself either. But you're not dropping off the face of the earth. Part and parcel with telling him to find a new place to live is giving yourself the emotional energy to chase after his emotional well-being more directly. You are giving him a choice (do x, y, or z and then deal with the consequences of that choice) so it is really up to him how that works out. But your love and concern for him stays exactly the same. Your desire to see him succeed and be happy stays exactly the same.

Probably not. The Free State Project has its strongholds (""Free Keene"" in particular is full of them), but overall this was an outgrowth of the 2010 Tea Party surge. Bill O'Brien's tenure saw a lot of controversial changes -- the removal of marital masters in family courts; ""stand your ground"" self-defense; attempts to repeal gay marriage. 

There is certainly a lot of overlap in some of their goals, but the fact that this was Tea Party driven, rather than FSP driven, can be seen in the 2012 electoral results. Republicans lost control of the state's lower legislative house (though not the state senate), a Democratic governor was elected, we now have only one Republican member of Congress... you get the idea. The Tea Party has waned; the FSP is still basically the same corps of activists. If it were the FSP causing this, then you'd expect to see it sustained."

This man was approached and repeatedly told the guy with the knife to back down. He had a steady pace about him as he approached the officer and with a knife in his hand the policeman had every right to defend himself.

The thing we need to take into consideration is what went on in the officers mind? This wouldn't have been a situation which allowed the officer hours of thinking time, he thought, it's fight or flight. And in his mind he would rather fight and put that guy down than run away. 

If anything I would concede that five shots may constitute as being a bit trigger happy, but surely it's better that an officer shot a man who was approaching him (without making his intentions clear, that point I can't stress enough) with a knife than say for example some random black teenager getting the shit kicked out of him and shot because he had some weed. 

&gt;The officer did was he was trained to do, this tells me the policing system is the problem. 

Not necessarily. I'm sure any serving or ex US policeman or woman could probably say that there would be several things he didn't adhere to through training protocols. BUT it does not mean that this incident highlights the failures and the bad side of the policing system. This video should in no way be related to a conspiracy. There's nothing to have conspired about. 

I don't subscribe to this subreddit as I don't like the stories coming up in my news feed, I usually visit it as a single subreddit. But I had to subscribe to post this because I really hate to see this sub-reddit trigger happy themselves that when there's something slightly controversial it has to be the establishment that are trying to promote the NWO. 

This video should be left alone as an example to PEOPLE not police, that regardless of what's happening, DON'T FUCKING APPROACH AN ARMED COPPER WITH A FUCKING KNIFE IN YOUR HAND! 

Obviously coming from the UK my view on policing is different, but here... If I was for whatever reason in my own house, not responding with to a police officers calls/demands and I had two (or one was it?) knife(ives) in my hand(s) armed police would be called (possibly a taser unit) BUT if I approached an armed officer I would be laughing in their faces if they didn't shoot me down."

[**The Manx**](http://manxpub.com/menu/) Also on Elgin, close to both Oz Cafe and El Camino. Funky, hipstery basement pub with copper tables and awesome food. IIRC the head chef left her position at Atelier (probably the priciest restaurant in the city) to work at the Manx.

[**Tennessy Willems**](http://twpizza.com/menu/). Thin crust, wood oven pizza with a nice variety of toppings. Hintonburg area close to the Hintonburg public house.

If going more for drinks than the food [**Pub Italia**](http://www.pubitalia.ca/menu.html) has a monstrous beer menu and general pub level food, only Italian (pasta, pizza, mussels, etc...). If you decide to keep drinking and want cocktails, **The Moon Room** is only a few doors down (and has pricier drinks). It's a bit of a walk down Preston from Two Six Ate.

If you decide on the Hintonburg neighbourhood places, and it's not early in the week, you can go check out [**Beyond the Pale**](http://beyondthepale.ca/) for a free beer tasting.

Cheers!"

bunker_man,AskReddit,1389967751.0,"This, more or less. People seem to forget that the legal justification for abortion is not a moral argument that it's not wrong in any fashion, which very few people make an honest attempt to believe without ulterior motive. It's just a declaration that based on practical concerns combined with how laws are, that they found what more or less is ultimately a loophole to exploit that they can legally declare valid. A combination of insecurity over this, combined with wanting to erase opposition on legal grounds turned into the bizarre postmodern campaign that doesn't even try to pretend that it's not totally ignoring the issue altogether for practicality. This, combined with anger, helps propagate the idea that even if someone admits they have no argument altogether that makes it not immoral from an individual perspective, (regardless of legality) that it's somehow more offensive to even call it's prevalence an issue than it is to use it irresponsibly, and advocate doing so.

Honestly, looking at any debate about this online, or wherever else with an open mind immediately reveals this. It's inconvenient to even allude to it being a problem, so a very careful care is taken by most people to ensure no one refers to it in any ways that indicate they can even understand why someone might have a problem with it."

ianp622,TheBluePill,1389967944.0,"1. Many people mistake cockiness and arrogance with genuine confidence. Sometimes arrogance is deserved - does this guy deserve it? This girl (I'm going to say that she likes him just to play along with your suspicion) might think he's confident, and that's a turn on. She may wise up in the future when she gets to know him better - was it still a success if she dumps him when she finds out the truth? Well, it depends on your goals - if you have red pill goals of just sleeping around, then it was a success. If you actually want a relationship, then it was a failure. 

2. Don't think that all women make this mistake (one of the biggest issues with TRP is overgeneralization). You may be able to fool some girls, but this is only a legitimate strategy if you buy into the idea that all women are the same and terrible. If you're actually looking for the right person, you probably already threw them away with the first neg.

3. Being shy and nice doesn't mean you can't be confident. A good person will see that confidence shine through even if you don't say much - through your body language, the way you talk, and how you respond to situations. TRP tries to put on a front to cover up their insecurities - they have to ""demonstrate value"" by putting people down because they don't have the inherent self-worth to demonstrate that simply by being a good person."

Having both cars drive into a concrete block side by side would be good too though. However you'd get hardheads coming out and saying ""no no, I mean old cars were better versus the plastic cars of today.""

I find it rather sinister to be honest. All utopian, no conflict, everyone looks good, everythings nice and pleasant and people only talk politely and about good things. Allah also removes all unpleasant feelings so we no longer care about our loved ones in hell either. 

Won't you eventually get bored of having no duties, no responsibilities, there is nothing to do, in fact there is no point in doing anything. Nothing you do in heaven is for constructive purposes, there is no need for survival, no need to provide for others or make the world a better place, or to create a legacy or simply to help people. There is absolutely no motivation to do anything in heaven apart from the pathetic attempt to stave off the inevitable doom that is boredom. 

Of course the muslim will argue that in heaven there are things the eyes have never seen, the mind has never imagined. I myself used to fantasize that heaven must be in a more complex dimension than this three dimensional one we find ourselves in. Perhaps heaven has 11 dimensions! But then I came to the realisation that we make heaven what we want it to be. For 7th century arabs in the middle of the desert it was a lush green place, full of running rivers of milk and wine, beautiful virgins and colourful food. For me it was the realisation of all these wonderful ideas that stemmed from my interest in science, for poor people it is a place free of hunger and worry, for oppressed people it is about freedom. But in the end it's all a fantasy, a mirage.

Tarnsman4Life,BDSMcommunity,1389968444.0,"What others have said your ""Dom"" sounds at best like a switch, at worst a closet sub. Nothing wrong with that, but he has no business trying to dominate you while trying to get you to ""top him from the bottom""-ish? Then again it doesn't sound like he is topping you much at all!

Have a frank discussion with him, explain to him you are submissive , you are not dominant, you will never be dominant, you have no desire to be dominant and him pushing you to become dominant over him is a huge turn off. 


Tweezle brings up a good point below; it sounds like your ""dom"" has some needs you simply can't meet. One of three things needs to happen, he is going to put those aside and get back to dominating you, you are going to allow him to find someone else to dom him and he will continue to dom you, or you will simply have to move on and find a more dominant dude.

Honestly, from this alone...
*Also, I don't know if this is related but we don't really have sex unless 1. I instigate it or 2. I tell him I don't want to have sex.*

I don't have much confidence that he can turn himself around and dominate you properly, it may be time to think of moving on.

Sorry to be so somber on a Friday; this happens far too often. One of the girls I play with casually is a switch, she knew I am 110% dominant going into things and she keeps making comments about me waking up tied up...I told her that  the last(and only) person who ever tried that ended up with a dislocated shoulder(unintentional) and that pretty much shut her down once and for all.

It was first know as the Congo Free State: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State

And then just as Belgian Congo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo

&gt;The loss of life and atrocities inspired literature such as Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and raised outcries. Excess deaths in this period are believed to number up to 10 million.[2] One view is that the forced labour system directly and indirectly eliminated 20% of the population.[3] European and U.S. reformers exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public through the Congo Reform Association. Also active in exposing the activities of the Congo Free State was the author Arthur Conan Doyle, whose book The Crime of the Congo was widely read in the early 1900s. By 1908, public pressure and diplomatic manoeuvres led to the end of Leopold II's rule and to the annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389968662.0,"&gt;And moral agents can be guilty of moral wrong for not attending to the suffering of others.

And a moral relativist might disagree with you on this. Especially considering the addendum you have there:

&gt;(I don't mean predator/prey situations, but, say, preventing a panda from rolling over and crushing her cub).

Why is one permitted to prevent one action but not the other? What if in the former situation, the prey would experience a lot more pain than the panda cub? Do you think a moral agent would be obligated to act?

&gt;I would think even a lone person on a private island, their own well being is at stake and they are tasked with being a steward over it.

Imagine more a lone person that had never encountered another person before in their lives.  Do you think they would form a moral compass?

&gt;From the fact that you need persons for there to be morality it shouldn't follow that whatever those people happen to believe about morality is what morality is.

I'm less saying what morality is with my statement, and more saying that it's only a social lubricant - a way to make things go smoothly within a society. The morals come from the individuals, and aggregate over time to echo the beliefs of the general populace.

&gt;Clearly such beliefs can about something but still be wrong.

This would make no sense in the perspective of a moral relativist. I can *disagree* with the morals and find them reprehensible, but that does not mean that they're truly wrong. If it was an objective fact that to save the world, we had to sacrifice a person once every 10 years - what would be the right thing to do?

Let's return to your previous point about predator/prey relationships. You acknowledge that the act of killing another organism in of itself is not a wrong action, but it only translates to having qualities of right and wrong once a sapient being enters the equation. What ultimately motivates this being to follow such a code? What is the benefit of adhering to it?

&gt;If whatever society believes is moral, then you shouldn't really be able to differentiate your subjective experience from everything else and rely on it as a source of moral insight.

Whatever society believes is *law*. Laws are echos of individual morals, and do not get translated as closely. The practice and law of not imbibing alcohol that arose during prohibition and is still a tenant in several religions is based off the idea that one should not cloud their mind. Banning abortion follows from a desire to not take human life. But *everything* has exceptions which I think can justify them if reduced to the absurd, and to me that means that there are no objective moral truths."

""While I’d love to say that the book is for everyone, it’s really not. The topic discussed in the book, that is stubborn body fat, only really becomes a problem when males and females get to a fairly low level of body fat. On average, this might be 10-12% for men and perhaps 15-17% for women.""

Them in their 18 wheelers and me in my BMW.  Then it happened. My exit came and I had to go. 6 hours of riding with these guys from the time I got on the interstate until the time I had to get off. I didn't know what to do. Should I just go with them? Forget my life and ride with these guys for the rest of my days or go to grandmas house? It was tough, but in the end I chose Nanny.

yourdungeonmaster,rpg,1389968817.0,"A few ways around this:

* Most of my traps require other skills to disarm.  For example, the PC may have to succeed on a climb to get to a mechanism, or find a secret door that leads to a small chamber where the dart-firing device is.  This is where the disable device roll occurs, not back in the hall with the pressure plate (and the rogue might have to make other decisions, like should he trust to his disarm roll, or try acrobatics to avoid setting the thing off?)
* Hidden rolls.  The rogue attempted to disarm the trap, but did he succeed?  Does he tell the others the pressure plate is safe?  Dare he try to remove the poison darts from the device?
* Secondary defenses.  The rogue found a secret door, disabled some dart gun hidden behind the wall, and appears now to have a clear shot to jump across a pit of acid and onto a platform with the prize.  He steps back, runs forward, and jumps!  He rolls a 12, which combined with his bonuses means he makes it easily...except there's an invisible barrier between him and the platform.  Splat!  And down he slides into the treacherous liquid below."

Drunken_Black_Belt,AskReddit,1389968854.0,"Oh god I have a ton I've posted on here already.  I'll post one of my favorites though:

Was working Loss Prevention for a major retailer.  Was a slow day, not many people in the store, and no thieves.  I had just gotten settled, and my manager M, and coworker S (both females) were chatting away.  I sat down at the cameras, and within a minute I see this young couple walk in.  And I mean young. 13/14 at most.  

The couple walks straight into the lower level entrance, and then proceeds to head to one of the fitting rooms, without picking up anything.  This happens somewhat often, people wanting to spice up the sex life by trying it somewhere new.  Or in this case, actually just have some time to themselves, being so young.  Usually we just kick them out, but if it's a extreme case, like their are children in the immediate area, we will call the cops and detain them.

I let my co workers know what's up, and head downstairs to interrupt. I approach the fitting room stall, and can see under the door a pair of feet and another set of legs, on it's knees.  I knock and tell them I'm with store security and need them to exit the fitting room.  I hear some shuffling, and the male attempts to just walk by me casually saying ""We were trying stuff on"".  I block the fitting room exit, and basically give them the ""we are just kicking you out, but you're lucky"" speech, when the radio crackles to life.

S: Hey Drunken_Black_Belt, M says hold them there.

I see the kid's eyes go wide, and immediatly begin to sweat.

Kid: M?  

DBB: Yea that's my boss

K:  She about 32?  Lesbian but looks like a dude?  

And then he goes on to describe my boss to a T.

DBB: Yea? You know her?

Kid: She used to date my mom

Disgonnabegood.gif

M comes down, and says ""Julio! WTF are you thinking?  You think you're momma is going to like this?  She raised you better than that? Hell so did I!  And you, Missy! You think this is love?  Blowing someone in a fitting room?  You're better than this dumbass!""

She basically just ripped into him for 5 solid minutes before telling him she'd be in touch with his mom later, and made him leave.  Now, I've had some moment's where I had to keep my shit together.  Whether it was the mother who cursed me out when she found out I wasn't Christian, despite the fact I was tallying all the clothes she had just stolen.  Or the kid who tried to convince me that song by Akon were ""the songs of his people"" and I was denying his rights to sing them in the holding room of our office.  Or the Pauly D wanna be who was so busy trying to get his dick wet with my coworker S that he stole right in front of us without realizing it. But I have NEVER lost it as hard as I did when M was ripping into this kid.  It was glorious.  Imagine the fear of your mom yelling at you, except she wasn't your mother anymore so there wasn't that guaruntee she'd hold back out of love.  

That's just one of my stories I've had while working LP and security.  I can post links to my other stories if wanted.  

**TL;DR-  I blue myself**

There's no actual evidence that this is the case though. It's something that people assume that if they keep saying that people will believe. Pro life people are associated with the general group that does the most charity of anyone on earth. Now while it IS true that they mistakenly think welfare is bad, this itself comes from a few problems.

Fluffiebunnie,Economics,1389969468.0,"Unions as a concept seem as natural as the idea of management in corporations. The owners of most corporations today do not manage them themselves, but pay others to do it (CEO, management etc). 

Individual employees don't have time to engage in the never ending conversation of certain workplace related issues, and hire/vote representative to do it for them.

The problem really arises when you start using legislation to boost either's position. If you boost the position of unions too much, you end up in a situation where compensation is too high, unemployment is high and the competitiveness of the nation is poor. Especially if you're an EU country, you can't even devalue your currency to bring down real compensation and increase competitiveness.

When it comes to minimum wage, I secretly wish we'd just start experimenting with it in developing countries to try and settle the debate once and for all. I know it's probably not very ethical, but I'm a curious creature."

Does the egg inside the ravioli stay liquid, or you manage to boil them enough to make them solid? They usually have a really short boiling time, I can't imagine having time to cook the egg inside too.

The traditional ravioli where I was born are the ravioli with ricotta and spinaches (usually dressed with sage butter), or the ""agnolotti al plin"" that are always ravioli but with very small and with a meat stuffing, and are usually boiled and served in a beef broth, instead of water.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnolotti

I like how you are doing all the ingredients by yourself, that isn't easy. Both the guanciale and the ricotta require a lot of attention to prepare. Guanciale is very hard to find, it is the traditional meat used for the carbonara, even if usually bacon is used, being way more common!"

One of the (many) mindsets in the US that makes it difficult to move forward with progressive ideas like a higher minimum wage, basic income, universal healthcare, and/or WIC/welfare needs is that a significant number of Americans feel that if they're paying taxes to take care of their neighbor, that tax-payer then has a say in what the neighbor uses the tax money for.  You can see this regularly in criticisms of ""welfare moms"" who have nice hair or painted nails or who are carrying decent knock-offs of designer bags.

YouBWrong,AskMen,1389969531.0,"I was 19, and had just come back from basic training for a few weeks of leave.  I was a virgin still, and I think basic had finally given me the polish of confidence that I needed to approach girls.  I was not prepared for them to suddenly start approaching me though.

So I'm in my home town and my best buddy arranges a going away party for me before I leave for Europe.  A lot of drinking went on, and a couple of girls who had generally ignored me before start showing interest.  But I don't know how to deal with that at all so I stick to drinking.

One of them, who is probably the only female in the tri-state area that I would not voluntarily have sex with (tragic combination of crazy and unattractive) starts literally chasing me around the house.  I spend about an hour hiding from her before she finally gets the hint.  

But then comes S.  S is this girl who I kind of had a crush on but she had a psycho boyfriend.  Also she kind of struck me as the kind of girl who was always looking to get rescued.  A guy in uniform looks like a white knight to some girls and I think that was happening here.  But she's at the party by sans psycho and we start making out a little.  She drags me into the bathroom and for the first time in my life I'm going to have SEX!!!

We're making out and I'm so eager and drunk that I can't figure out to get her panties off before eating her out.  Despite all that I'm making some real progress and I'm super excited.  BTW, there is NO condom in sight here so lord knows how it's going to turn out at this point.

Then I hear her boyfriend from the next room yelling over the music and the chatter.  ""WHAR IS MAH GURLFRIEND!!!!""

Then one of my good buddies yells back ""IN THE BATHROOM WITH YOUBWRONG!!!""

In those five seconds I went from a diesel locomotive charging down the line at 100 mph, to timid little squirrel hunting for shelter in the winter forest.  I still feel ghost pain from the blue balls that it caused."

She gets down on her knees and crawls through the pigpiss mud slop and snuggles up to the pig, her fingers tracing along it's belly until she finds it's cock. She begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens, her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh #2 pencil. She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig's greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig's thrusting. ""Oh fucking jesus god yes.."" she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig's squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig's ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig's balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it's pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it's tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig's own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig's butthole and it's wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig's hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep.

ShadowPoga,GetStudying,1389969724.0,"&gt; 1 . I myself have the loser/quitter attitude as well. I find it's a pretty person dependent problem though, your reason may be very different from mine. I personally quit because I get anxiety over being judged and thought less of if I fail, and thus frequently set unreasonable expectations of myself. /r/HowToNotGiveAFuck helps out with this a bit, but really its about finding the reason you think this way and fighting your own personal demons.
&gt; 
&gt; 4 .  Start drinking tea. It's not a quick fix to the problem, but I started having 3-4 cups throughout the day and the [theanine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine) plus caffeine keeps me from getting tired over things that I'd use to stop 10 minutes into doing. Combined with working on number 1 you'll find yourself much more productive.
&gt; 
&gt; 3 . I dunno what you do. I use to play league of legends excessively. As in almost 1000 hours in a year. I uninstalled it over winter break and this problem almost vanished. Don't just quit whatever it is you do cold turkey, find a hobby to replace it first (I swing dance now. It's awesome.)
&gt; 
&gt; 2 . Here's what I do, but it is honestly something you must develop yourself. My primary management tool is www.habitrpg.com. I keep track of things I want to get rid of and want to improve with the habits section (stop biting nails, eat more fruits and veggies, spend 60s intervals thinking about why I want to make all As). I keep track of daily/weekly events like going to every class, getting out of bed on my alarm (6AM), and doing my nightly routine of stretching, brushing, and flossing. I put things I need to do in the To Do section. Homework assignments both long and short term, buying textbooks, things I need to read for class. I have it on my phone, and pinned on my desktop and laptop browsers.
&gt; 
&gt; That's just the first layer and sort of my 'catch all'. I also have a simple folder that I put all my class syllabi in, and that has a sheet of paper per class that I write a single line in detailing what I do in each class each day. Always in my back pack, this gives me an easy means to glance at the intended schedules of my teachers so I can use their time management as well. I also use to write anything that would pop into my head as a To Do on a notecard and keep it in my pocket. Now I do it with an app called Everstudent instead, but frankly the notecard is much better especially to start. I also put all my listed assignments/tests in my syllabus onto google calendar. Gives me an easy glance over to see when I'm assignment heavy and when I'm not.

Some tips.  

1. Whenever you have something to do. Pull out a piece of paper and write these three questions on it. You could even save a template and stick it on your desktop and open it instead if that'd be 'easier'.  *What do you need to do?*  **Why do you need to do it?** ***How would you do it?*** Answer them. You're 90% done with your task now.  

2. Don't sit and struggle over something to the point you avoid it. If you can sense you're procrastinating with a paper, get up and do some jumping jacks, go for a walk, come back and make your bed. Don't sit and browse reddit hoping inspiration will suddenly strike you and the paper will fall out of the sky. BREAK YOUR ROUTINE.

3. Be intentional with your time. If you don't have anything to do to, schedule it as free time, don't just leave it as time to do anything. I would mark this as the primary component of time management. It's not about doing things with your time. It's about telling your time to do things. It doesn't have to be strict, but it does need to be intentional. I'm writing this during my 9-11 study hour (this isn't studying), but once I'm done writing this I intend to close reddit and finish my summary of Locke's ""Of Property"". Will I? We'll see. But, a plan is at least there.

4. It won't happen today. It won't happen tomorrow. But start now anyway. The progress I've made the past few years is phenomenal, but I know it was because I worked at it over and over again regardless of what did and didn't work, and I still have quite a ways to go. You will not see how far you've climbed up the mountain by sitting at the base imagining what it's like at the peak.

5. Look in the mirror. Think about what you see. You don't have to like it, you don't have to dislike it. But everything you're seeking help with boils down to taking a good hard look at yourself and your life and examining it. ""Unexamined life is not worth living"" or however Aristotle said it."

Taking their lead from the British Court, where Edward VII followed George V's lead in getting tattooed; King Frederick IX of Denmark, the King of Romania, Kaiser Wilhelm II, King Alexander of Yugoslavia and even Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest.

The fact you think the only two variables are weight and speed REALLY highlights your total naivety and lack of even basic understanding., if they were solid rigid lumps then yes, but as they are highly engineered force dissipaters, your ""view"" is total garbage "

1.  I can't gain strength on a cut. Once I hit 1x BW bench/1.5x BW squat that was it for putting on strength without eating a lot.  The problem is...

2.  My partitioning is way shittier.  I feel like I put on .75+lb fat for every .25lb muscle.  That might just be my body though, I've never been muscular and was always chubby. "

Give it a year or two and people will forget about the movie; just like after Free Willy, people were up in arms about Orcas in captivity, but these parks still survived.

But some people really do need the assistance of a tailor to get well-fitting casual clothes. For example, I'm 6'6"" and about 170lbs. I'm very tall and very lanky. The unfortunate truth is that there just aren't well-fitting clothes that are available to me off-the-rack. If I want something, even an ocbd, to fit decently I have to get it tailored.

Everytime I visited a gun store to buy ammo or cleaning products, i either chatted with the clerks/owners, or overheard them talking with people about the new laws.  When I was on FB I followed several store pages, and all of them made posts with each new change of legislation.

The registration was known about for months and months and months.  Part of being a responsible gun owner is keeping up with current regulations and laws, regardless of whether or not you believe they are right ( for the record the magazine laws are idiotic, and there is no way to enforce them without serial numbers on the magazines themselves.  Plus it's not enforcable without having commited a crime first, so if you're going to commit a crime with a gun, the fact that you don't want to break the law again is irrelevant).

I had my LB replaced free of charge, outside warranty. I believe Nvidia footed the bill after a considerable legal debacle as the fault was their own. I also think this affected other manufacturers using this chipset.

But, I was in this position. I was a 16 year old girl dating a 20 year old. We were in two completely different places in life. The main issues in my life were my parents and school. In his, it was getting a job, moving out, and paying bills. 

I remember when we broke up...well...when he broke up with me. He told me that we had nothing in common. Which completely crushed me. Thinking back on it now, at the age of 23, I totally agree. If we had stayed together that would have been awful. 

But, I am not trying to sway you away from the relationship, but as others have said, 5 months is a short amount of time. Also, thinking as someone that IS your dudes age, this is no way in hell that I would date someone as young as you. No offense in any way, but under the age of 20 is too young for me. We would just be in completely different areas of life, and dating someone that young would just be out of the question. 

As I said, I am not trying to sway you from this relationship or that happiness. I know when I was dating my ex, there was nothing anyone could say that would make me see different. I just want you to be safe. Okay?

Theungry,AskMen,1389970712.0,"I'm from MA.

I own a shotgun, and have hunted with it, however not in the last 10 years or more.

My opinion is that ideally people should have the right to arm themselves to hunt and for self defense, but that gun ownership should carry much more serious regulatory controls than it does currently.  Basically, I would use car ownership as a model.  You need a license.  You need to renew your license periodically, and undergo relevant testing.  You need insurance that covers both your car, and you controlling a different car.  Insurance companies through the free market set rates based on how likely you or your car are to cause harm.  You car itself needs to be registered, and it needs to pass inspection regularly.

I don't put any stock in slippery slope ""the government will take all our guns"" fears.  Private US citizens already hold more guns by a factor of 10 than our combined armed forces and police force."

InfinitelyThirsting,AskWomen,1389970733.0,"I think the problem is that you are ignoring the fact that you can't just expect a woman to already be horny when you are. If you had phrased it more as ""I would like a woman who would initiate quickies when she was in the mood"", that's different from ""I am so tired of women not being constantly aroused whenever I want them to be"".

The way you're talking about it, whether you mean it or not, you seem to be petulant that women don't become sexually aroused from nothing in two minutes, when you spring it on them. It's not that women are less horny than men, it's just that if a woman is not already aroused, it takes longer to be ready for sex than for a man in a similar position. A guy can usually get hard pretty quickly, even when totally flaccid, but ladyparts just don't work like that. I can be mentally dripping wet horny, but physically it takes time to reach that state.

It's like... if you want the frozen pizza for dinner. You still have to wait for the oven to preheat. Now, someone else can turn the oven on and have it ready when you get home, but it still takes the same amount of time, regardless.

soafraidofbees,AskAcademia,1389970785.0,"I had lunch with a Nobel laureate last year and I asked him what he looks for when he's hiring a student or employee to work in his lab. He said he'll usually start by describing the research a bit and asking them questions: ""This project is looking at proteins that bind to microtubules. [pause] Do you know what microtubules are?"" 

Bad candidate: ""Oh yeah, totally."" [does not elaborate, may be BSing]

Meh candidate: ""I think so... they're part of the cytoskeleton, right?""

Hire immediately: Before even being asked, interrupts with ""Microtubules? Can you remind me what those are?""

The absolute *worst* thing a student can do, in my opinion, is to fake that they know something they're clueless about. You're there to learn. There's no shame in not knowing something yet. And it's far, far better to have the humility to admit that you don't know something than to pretend that you've got it all figured out only to become completely overwhelmed later. This isn't just true in laboratory sciences but in every discipline. My students who are struggling with the material but come to every review session/office hours appointment and ask me what else they can do to learn the material are the ones who stick out in my mind and get fantastic letters of recommendation, even if they got a B in my class."

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1389970863.0,"I saw this question last night, but I headed to bed before I could answer. I wanted to make it clear that, while the Romans did many things, *teaching slaves to fight was actually something that scared them, too.* One of the greatest nightmares of Rome was for their slaves to turn upon their masters - something that seems common for slave owners, really. However, I did want to make something clear - the *very* rare occasions when the Romans used slaves in the military (after Canae and Teutoberg, for example), it was in the case of a national emergency - and they weren't ""legions,"" so much as they were ""auxiliary troops."" No, the legions were proudly Roman citizens - and no slave would be a part of them.

Now, as to the question on whether the Servile Wars changed Rome's stance on gladiators - it really didn't. Remember that, although the vast majority of gladiators were slaves, there were a not-insignificant number of Roman citizens and free men (and even some women!) who became gladiators themselves for the fame and fortune that it would bring. However, stricter laws against gladiators *were* enacted - most famously, there were laws against having more than a certain number of gladiators in one place, which played logistical hell with massive gladiator tournaments that big names liked to hold in Rome - but made it extremely difficult for them to revolt. Interestingly enough,  for the wars against the Cimbri and the Teutones (ca. 105 BCE), Caius Marius took the army that had been trained by Rutilius Rufus during his (Rufus') consulship. When training that army, as they were also taken from Rome's poorest citizens, Rufus had brought in a gladiatorial trainer to teach them weapons handling. The techniques that were used in that training programme were then adopted by the Roman army for the next few centuries.

Hope that helped a bit :) If you're interested in Spartacus, I highly recommend checking out Barry Strauss' *The Spartacus War.* If you're interested in more on the Roman legions, a fantastic book is Adrian Goldsworthy's *The Roman Army at War.* If you're interested in the *leaders* of the Roman army and how they shaped Rome herself, check out Goldsworthy's *In the Name of Rome*. I used knowledge from all of the above to form my answer :) "

A large google hangout can come close, but there is a small difference. A videochat is meant to be a group talk. A VR minecraft, isn't meant to be anything.

Conversely the dates I've gone on where I've tried really hard to be a datable person have not gone well at all.  The difference being, I was putting myself into an activity where other people were doing the same thing.  Our only shared experience at that point was we were looking to be with someone.  Why not start off doing something you like to begin with and then see who's around you?  Why not work toward improving yourself for YOU first?

Unless someone really likes dating as a hobby, then by all means, have fun.  I would rather do things that make me happy, things that help me learn and grow as a person first.  There's no reason you can't keep an eye out for someone nearby doing the same thing.

Not sure if the used car metaphor is very kind, and not terribly appropriate.  A used car can't also look for a car-less owner if left alone.  There's no Plenty of Wheels match site for cars and owners.  Finding a significant other CAN happen when you are just being optimistic, healthy, doing your own thing.  I'm not saying you sit at home doing all those things, you still have to be out there, but be out there for you first.  Then if there's someone there with you, ask them out.  That's all.

ice_candle,AskMen,1389971136.0,"Put yourself in the mindset of somebody not in the US, where the constitution does not give the right to weapons, then answer the question as asked - What is your opinion on gun ownership? Should I, in the UK have the right to own a gun because it is in the US constitution, should a civilian in France, Kenya or Afghanistan? It is absurd to think that a 200 year old document should be the moral definition for the world. That is why I said it is irrelevant for this argument.

Representatives aren't a public vote. They were elected, sure, but out of a small pool. I feel the same way about our politicians deciding this as your politicians: too many vested interests. That's why I said a public vote.

We're talking about guns here, not rape. Don't use fallacies in arguments, they aren't sound.

I'm not saying that I am representative of everybody, but being beat on shouldn't mean a race to arms. There are also plenty of non-lethal means of self-defence such as tazers and pepper spray.

I wasn't aware that police officers were allowed to conceal carry, I thought their weapons were always visible. I'll concede the point.

A swimming pool can't be used in anger. It can't be taken out of the property. I would hope that parents educate and supervise their kids (I know it isn't always the case) if they have pools. Again, though you're using fallacies.

Maybe my comprehension skills are lacking... 

&gt; Sure it might reduce violent crime by a portion

Nope, I was correct. Logical fallacies, again. In a debate about gun control not nut control. A nut wasn't created to kill, it is an accidental quirk that some people have allergies; you take reasonable precaution to avoid. Actually, I think that cars should be limited in speed (not horsepower) for use on public roads. I drink and enjoy it, but I also know the medical advice and costs to our healthcare system. I'm sure that I would be annoyed and I would moan, but I don't think I have a right to drink alcohol. It is already limited to over-18s, they are trying to introduce minimum pricing in the UK, which I support.

As per my argument that the constitution should be taken out of this debate. I'm trying to take this argument out of what is present day America and put it in a moral and social arena. 

If there was gun control, the likelihood that a home invader would have a gun is greatly reduced. Don't you think it's disproportionate to the risks, in a society where few have guns, for you to have one at home on the very rare off-chance that you will suffer a home invasion? "

You can do better with eGaspy, and without spending a billion points supporting thralls you frankly don't need and creating a massive dependency on Tartarus to actually hit anything with decent defense. You'll walk right over casual players but anyone accustomed to playing against eGaspy is going to find this pretty simple to dismantle.

This might sound weird, but bear with me: Cut the thralls, UA, and Tartarus to free up 15 points. Take a second unit of full Knights, and some Biles to deal with high DEF stuff. Knights in general are a little scarier than thralls thanks to the built-in pathfinder from Ghostly and slightly increased threat range, and Biles plus Excarnate is just plain mean. You can use Mist templates to deny a charge or prevent Biles from getting shot at depending on the opponent, and your opponent has too many Knights on the table to reliably kill a whole unit in one turn, ensuring you'll get your Vengeance attacks.

Oh course, you'll probably still want BLT for that wonderful 2"" extra movement on the charge, so I'd drop the combine. I don't think Gaspy really needs the free upkeep or their magical attacks badly enough to justify the 5 points.

Those remaining 2 points can be used for a lot of fun things, but I'm generally fond of Bloat thralls to draw shooting and take stabs at low ARM infantry.

grautry,AskReddit,1389971298.0,"I'll try a simple explanation here.

So let's say you have 1000$ that you can afford to lose and your bet is 1$. You lose, the bet becomes 2$, you lose, the bet becomes 4$ and so on and so forth.

In order to lose your entire money supply, you'd have to lose about 10 times in a row(1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128+256+512 = 1023). The chances of you losing 10 times in a row are 1 in 1024.

Seems unlikely, right? Surely, you can win with this strategy in the long term? **Wrong**.

See, the thing is, in order to double your money(ie. go from 1000$ to 2000$), you have to place **1000** bets. When you're placing a thousand bets, that 1 in 1024 chance of a losing streak suddenly doesn't seem all that unlikely, does it? In fact, given the thousands(or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands...) of bets you're going to place, it seems pretty much inevitable that at some point, you'll face a losing streak exactly like that."

However, over the last couple of months they stopped talking to me, and I come to find out the male of the couple has been texting her on a daily basis and invites her over to sleep at their house frequently.**

They were never your friends if they acted like this. Friends do NOT do this to anothers woman. Period. Scumbags do this. Lesson learned, keep that leash tight when you find a submissive woman.





**I know that several people in our local scene have told her good show for not letting some man tell her what to do**

**I just really came into the scene about a year ago, and it's done me a world of good. Now I'm all terrified about being pushed out of it by my ex and a few senior people with serious boundary issues.
Part of this is me wanting to vent without stirring the pot with people directly connected to the situation, but more than that, I really just don't know how I'm supposed to handle this going forward. I feel like I put myself in an emotionally vulnerable position and got burned badly, and I'm having an impossible time trying to pick my head back up and go out again.

""Stirring the pot"" will accomplish nothing, especially if the couple who poached this girl from you have rank within it. Find another munch. 
In regards to emotion, obviously you had a lot more invested in the relationship than your girl friend-thingie there did. Another harsh lesson about letting that happen, it often ends with pain.

The only constructive things you can do are move on to another group, learn the lessons painfully bestowed by this situation and try not to repeat history in the future. Most of all; do NOT let one crappy experience turn you off to the whole thing. Fortune favours the bold"

GentlemanBAMF,smashbros,1389971380.0,"I can't tell if you're serious or not.

There's two inherent issues with your comparison. One is that you're talking about social evolution over thousands of years. Yeah, our life expectancy has also doubled. That didn't happen across a lateral generation, the comparison does't work. We don't just ""get smarter"" because time has passed.

Secondly, there's no evidence anywhere saying that humans are inherently more capable now than they were at the dawn of, say, the Greek empire. The fact that they were able to map the stars with fewer tools and technological assistances to astonishing accuracy indicates they have just as much capacity for knowledge and innovation as we do, despite the fact that civilization simply hadn't provided them with as many advantages. Could you do that? Or could you practice cartography because of the ""education"" you have now? That the average western citizen today is more educated says nothing about human capacity, it speaks to available resources to distribute knowledge more evenly and to assist through technology. 

And if you look at the current generation running through western school, particularly American or British, you might not be so quick to assume we're more capable than our ancestors."

austinanimal,AskReddit,1389971383.0,"My son ""G"" is on the autism spectrum better known as PPD-NOS. He usually plays quietly and keeps himself entertained with board games (a lot of Angry Birds jenga sets), video games, iPad, computer, or television. 

I was one room over from him in our home office one afternoon. I could hear him in the next room playing. I hadn't worried myself too much about it until I kept hearing him to ""wheeeeee"" and then more ""wheeeewhoooooo"".  

I walked in and had made himself a homemade slip'n'slide. This entailed finding the refill sized bottle of liquid hand soap from under the bathroom sink and spreading it out all over the linoleum floor of our very large master bathroom. 

He had stripped down to no clothes and covered himself in plenty of liquid hand soap for extra lubrication. He was launching himself across the floor and sliding on his butt or belly, having the time of his life.

 I couldn't even be mad at him because of the ingenuity of his plan for a bathroom slip'n'slide. It was a huge pain to clean it all up and I fell on my ass a few times trying to do so."

Because your snug underbust is so close to your tight underbust, you may find that a 30 band is more comfortable, and anyway, Nordstrom doesn't carry 28 bands. I don't suggest getting a 30 band in brands whose bands run loose (ex Betsey Johnson) or getting a 32 band. I believe that Nordstrom carries Elle Macpherson, and those bands run small, their 32 is more like a 30 and their 30 is more like a 28. The brand is expensive, but you might want to try some on just so you know what a 28 band will feel like. Calvin Klein is another brand that has firm bands. Also try the btempt'd by wacoal line - i suggest the ciao bella style in a 30D given what you have said about your breast shape.

Of course, not all bras in the correct size will fit you correctly. That is where shape comes in. I recommend trying on as many 30D as you can and reporting back how they fit. If need be, your cup size can be adjusted or we can recommend brands and styles that work for the shape of your breasts. If you are shallow, half cups, demi cups, and balconettes typically work.

Voltage is the amount of *potential* or more simply the *push* if you want to think of it that way. Ohms measure the resistance to current flow, think of it as a restriction; Amps (Ampere) can be thought of as the amount of electrons passing through the circuit. 

Water is sometimes used as analogy. Picture the Hoover dam. On one side is a *whole lot of water* just waiting to get through the dam. That's voltage (and a lot of it.) A pipe sticking through it jetting water out the other end, that water flow is amps. The restriction imposed by the diameter of the pipe, very loosely, is Ohms.

DO you think the force encountered by the STeel car is the same as the force encountered by the jelly car, or do you think perhaps the mass ejection and structural failure of the Jelly car would not have the same effect as solid steel.

Just make sure that they know you are *available* for any time they do want to talk. If possible, it may also be a good idea to suggest a close female family member/family friend (late teen/adult) they can talk to if that person is willing - sometimes as a teenage girl there are things you just can't talk to a boy about no matter who he is :P 

I didn't talk to my dad that much abut my problems growing up, mostly because I was very introverted, but it was immensely reassuring just to know that he was **there** and that he would care if I did need to talk.

I also think it's important to remember, as they hit their teen years, that they are still children and they still need punishments and still need to learn things. Not just to make sure they behave well, but because it show that you are still paying attention to their behaviour. I have known quite a few teenagers negatively affected because their parents started treating them like adults too early."

einTier,cars,1389971770.0,"I got to instruct a guy during a track day that had an F40 with upgraded turbos.  That's exactly what it was like -- no power, then a sudden kick in the ass.  

As others have said, to have this effect, you really need large turbos that take a while to spin up and build boost.  Most engines won't be built to handle that kind of power increase and most people won't enjoy driving them because you have to be very prepared for the sudden onset of power.  It's very difficult to control. 

Of course, in the 1980's, this was simply the state of turbo technology.  Now people can build similar amounts of boost with smaller, lighter turbos and the idea is to get away from turbo lag as much as possible.  I can't think of anything I've driven of even semi-modern vintage that would behave this way. 

Even my 1987 994 Turbo doesn't have quite the rush of power you're talking about, and it's right in the sweet spot for power and lag.  I run 15 pounds of boost and you notice the lag, but nothing like what you're talking about.  Then again, you can buy my 944 Turbo for $5,000 right now. "

Crumford Lal, Human Evangelist.  Have you heard the word of Toma Thule?  You haven't talked to Crumford yet, then.

Fairly certain teachers actually used to beat up kids who didn't sit still and that they expected them to read and understand material in even more depth than they do today. If anything, maybe we have become *too* understanding and lenient towards male students. Let's bring back harsh physical punishment for students who act out in class and go back to teaching with rote memorization and huge amounts of dry textbook readings. No more pictures in the textbooks or Wikipedia for students to use to understand what they're reading. A smack to the knuckles for chewing gum or sleeping in class! Sounds awesome. 

Any of the old school teachers I ever had were super strict about behaving in class and even more demanding that kids sit still and read for hours. I am confused as to what kind of teaching environment he thinks existed before feminism... 

I don't think classes have changed, I think the amount of physical activity outside of class has dramatically declined so the energy built up from that lack of exercise out in nature has created hyper students. "

It allows you to keep a handgun or two at relative arms length, ready to go if something goes ""bump in the night"" but is secure enough to keep your kids out.

Your carry firearm should be GTG as is just keep it on you at all times; don't muck it up leaving it on the bathroom counter or pool side while you swim in the back yard.

Besides that, get a big safe for your other fun stuff; bolt it to the floor and that should keep your kids out of it.
If you are like me and you want to have a rifle at the ready, there are ""rack"" systems with locks out there, you can keep the magazines in the Biometirc safe and still be pretty safe in regards to children.


About a respect for firearms, there is no magic age with teaching kids about guns. My father started with me around the time I was 6; some kids are not ready until 12 or 14, some are NEVER ready. Really you have a few years , at least 4 or 5 or 6 before you need to worry about teaching your kids about guns. Until then just stay safe.

by_a_pyre_light,battlefield_4,1389972171.0,"&gt; Yeah top shots that's a fair comparison.

Yeah, it is. I mentioned some very specific conditions where I get them **ALL. THE. TIME.** Battlefield 4 is a much more vertical game than its predecessors. Examples I used included: firing down from the many, many cliffs in Silk Road, firing from rooftops in Shanghai and Danwbreaker. You could also fire from bridges and rooftops in Floodzoone, and second stories and rooftops in Paracel Storm and Hainan Resort. In fact, in these last 3 maps, there are no tanks, only LAVs. 

My error was in reading the damage numbers for LAVs and Tanks wrong. I read them backwards. Yes, you're right, the LAW is the same damage as the SMAW against tanks in most of the cases, but, again, the samples I cited I come across a lot, so the chances of a critical hit up top are still pretty great.

&gt; You have to take time to aim it and still have a good chance to miss

For new, unskilled players, maybe. My accuracy with SMAWs is pretty high. I hit a lot of my targets most of the time. I've also used the LAW quite a bit between the ""beta"" (*cough* paid alpha *cough*) and it's a good weapon. I liked it quite a bit, especially when snipers communicate w/ the team that they're gonna be using the laser designators. However, for distance shots, the LAW simply isn't a good weapon. It refuses to lock onto vehicles, even ones right in front of it, and it doesn't fire as fast or straight as the SMAW. Thus, you are never quite sure for distances of a few dozen meters, if you need to compensate for the rocket drop, or if it will automatically pop up and lock onto the vehicle, which it sometimes does, sometimes doesn't. There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to it past close range. 

Up close, yes, it's a good weapon. However, it's simply not a universal weapon, or a weapon that fits *my* play style well.
 
It is undeniably the weakest rocket launcher in the game based on the raw numbers, it's not as fast or accurate at distance as the other ones, and against LAVs and Boats, it's critically weak vs. the other launchers. Therefore, it excels primarily in close range encounters, but it doesn't provide enough incentive to use over the other launchers.

Some of the damage stats: 

Rhib Boat (1 gun, 2 seats, driver)

* SMAW 52/52/65 to front/sides/back

* LAW 11 (....)

Attack Boat:

* SMAW 25 to front/sides/back

* LAW 5 (yeah....)

* SLAM 35

Jeeps

* SMAW 81/61/61 to front/sides/back

* LAW 42

We are masters of diffusing a situation with a single sarcastic comment or knowing smile, and we know when to leave things unsaid. Charismatic people tend to succeed in this country simply because they steamroll over the quiet, unassuming majority, particularly if they do it with good manners and a smile. If I'm in public, I'd prefer to share a knowing smile or glance with a stranger than stand up to somebody acting prattish, and I'd probably have a little daydream about what a superhero I could be if I did take a lone and righteous stand.

Kayden01,AskReddit,1389972542.0,"A few points. One, I ain't white, so shove the self righteous *crap*.
Two - I asked for examples of white privilege, you cited two instances of injustice suffered by black men - that *are not* injustices limited to black people.
Three - Yes, minorities have difficulties, at times. Not at all times. Not in all places. So do white people. So do brown people (this is likely the category I'd be in btw). It varies. It also usually has a hell of a lot more to do with how you present yourself and how you behave than with the color of your skin.

Your entire argument seems to boil down to 'White people have it easy, other people have thing difficult in a way that white people will never understand, and so, white people simply need to accept this burden of guilt, and should promote others before themselves. Because privilege.' And when met with resistance, you come out with ad homs, misdirection, goalpost moving and condescension. 

And to respond to the edit - because the US isn't the only place that this discussion is taking place, 'white privilege' is being thrown up as an excuse to take every kind of action you can think of in most of the western world. It is not however, being taken seriously. And yes, I'm pleased about that.

Suppose you have a pregnancy.  The kid is born on some day, Jan 12 for example.

The odds you give birth from a second pregancy on Jan 12 in 1 in 365.  Therefore the odds you would have a sibling with the same birthday who is not a twin in 1:365.

This woman had twins for her second pregnancy, but the odds are related to the pregnancies not the number of kids.

Now, the 4th kid is her 3rd pregnancy, and the odds that that child shares the same birthday as the 1st is still 1 in 365.  However the odds that all both the 2nd and 3rd share the same birthday as the 1st is the product of them: 1 in 133,225.

For four different pregnancies, it's actually a slightly tricky issue due to leap years.  But essentially it's 1 in 365^3 or 1 in 48,627,125."

Twice_Shy,needadvice,1389972624.0,"Have you communicated with the mortgage holder? There may be options they can offer that can help you.

For example, the bank may be able to modify the mortgage which can lower the monthly cost of the mortgage and help you keep the house (if that's your wish) or at least buy you some more time.

A short sale is where the bank works with the realtor on your behalf to sell the house for whatever they can get. If the amount of the loan is more than the selling priced of the house then you negotiate with the bank to forgive the difference.

Good luck!
I would contact the mortgage company and explain the circumstances. Loan holders don't want to foreclose on your property. The options I mentioned above are much more lucrative for the bank than a foreclosure."

This is at an angle to make sure I push the pesky hood out of my way. I used to be baffled by all the guys that would be really wimpy with my clit until I read about people like you who actually don't like much clit play.

Toys with a clit branch have a great design for people like me but I can understand avoiding them in your shoes. My favorite vibrator actually has nubs like this one that feel great against my clit, way better than creepy bunny ears do (I'm so weirded out by rubbing cuddly animal designs against my crotch).

That being said, the article mentioned this having two arms so I think it actually rests on the outer lips and simulates the part of the clit that isn't exposed. They really should've taken a photo at an angle that better illustrates this instead of making it look like another rabbit vibrator."

EatDiveFly,scuba,1389972905.0,"I dove a wreck in the St. Lawrence River, that had a mooring line attached, not to the wreck itself, but to a concrete block about 30 feet away. Then there was line along the bottom from the block to the bow of the wreck.



The vis was *about* 30 feet.  We were down 80 feet. The wreck was about 100 feet long.  The current went from bow to stern.



The dive consisted of swimming and exploring the wreck from bow to stern and back again.  We basically circled it a bunch of times.  



In the back of my mind i was thinking, ""the ascent line is *on* the bow"".  I mistakenly pictured a line attached to the wreck itself like it is in so many other wrecks I'd done.



After a few few circuits, i signaled to my buddy that we should surface.  I was a DM and she was AOW.  We were either at the bow or stern at that point, and i looked for the mooring rope that i thought was attached to the ship.  Not there.  Okay, i must be on the stern, let's swim to the other end.  Hmm, not there either.  Lets swim to the other end.  Repeat, Repeat Repeat.  Each time we're spending 2-3 minutes bottom time and using up air.  



Remember the concrete mooring block is just out of view because of vis limitations.  I was about to just surface with a free ascent, (which would be a drag because the current would take us way down river, it would be a difficult safety stop without a line to hang on to, and our dive boat was still moored at the wreck and we had no signalling tube).



Just as i made this decision, I noticed another diver coming  to the boat from the direction of the mooring block.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh eureka moment.  Now I remember, the ascent line  over *there*.   

We quickly swam to the line and made our way up.  

It seems really obvious, but ""know your exit strategy"".    I had a viable, safe plan B, but it would have been a drag to execute.

Theungry,AskMen,1389972964.0,"I am mostly with you on pro-gun ownership, but in the interest of good discussion, I think there are a couple of points worth nitpicking in your list:

&gt; It is an inalienable right, as outlined in our constitution. The entire point of the rights is that they do not expire or become obsolete

We've amended the constituion of the US 17 times after the bill of rights.  The point of the constitution was always to be a living document that changed with the times.  That's actually why the 2nd amendment is an amendment and not part of the body of the constitution in the first place.  It was a compromise after the fact.

Edit- this is just a nitpick on formal logic, and not substantive to the actual discussion from my perspective.  I like the second amendment, and support it's continued relevance.

&gt; Gun control only punishes the people who are already obeying the law, sure it might reduce violent crime by a portion (which, if I may point out, mostly takes place between gangs over drugs and territory) but that is not at all worth the loss of our rights.

Adding regulation inconveniences law abiding citizens, but more importantly it provides greater penalties for those caught breaking those laws.  There are countless analogies of the government acting as the appropriate body for holding people accountable for managing dangerous situations and equipment safely from cars to distribution of controlled substances.  The government makes mistakes, but the whole point of having a government is to manage risk and infrastructure for a society.  

I don't want to see just any gun control passed, but we can't even have a reasonable conversation about gun control in the legislature without a significant block lobbied by the NRA putting their fingers in their ears and going ""LALALALAGUNCONTROLISEVILICANTHEARYOU."" 

I think being highly skeptical of the government is good and healthy, but I ask why that skepticism doesn't also extend to pro gun government officials.  Why is their association with the NRA lobby, and the interests of the NRA not held to the same scrutiny.  After all, the NRA does not represent gun owners.  It represents the interests of gun manufacturers and their profits.

US civilians own over 300 million guns, including over 100 million rifles and over 100 million hand guns.  The US military and police force combined own less than 5 million guns of all types.

It's not exactly East Germany out there.

I say let Americans have the guns.   Let them use them and carry them and buy as many as they want.

Let's just be as safe with them as we are with other aspects of our society that carry comparable risk for harm.

clairebones,AskWomen,1389973003.0,"I think your example highlights a large part of the problem. The complaint isn't about being beautiful any more than it is about having won the money. The complaint is typically because when you have an 'extreme' quality (gorgeous/rich/highly intelligent/etc) people tend to forget that you are a real person. They turn it so that everything about you is related to that one single fact.

Say you were amazing at making toast. It's great, you really enjoy the toast you make, etc. Now imagine that every time anyone speaks to you they say 'How was your toast today?', or 'You're still great at making toast'. The only time people contact you is because they want you to make toast for them. The think it's fine to interrupt your job or your vacation because they want some nice toast. You've stopped being a complete person with your own life and your interests, now you are just 'the guy who makes the best toast'.

Being beautiful would (I imagine) be great. But if it was the only thing anyone ever noticed about you and the only reason anyone ever spoke to you, if people only cared about if you still looked beautiful, if they ignored your other skills ad hobbies just to talk about being beautiful, if they felt that they could interrupt your day just to tell you again that they think you are beautiful.

by_a_pyre_light,battlefield_4,1389973434.0,"&gt; You're interpreting the numbers wrong. 

Yes, you're right. I reversed the Tank and LAV numbers.

&gt; how did you get that figure anyway?

Well, since you already caught on to the fact that I got my vehicles reversed, the ""average"" was taken from the LAVs and Tanks, where I was seeing the 33/33/33 for all the angles on the LAVs and the top damage on the Tanks, and I'd mixed them up in my mind, thinking that they were the same vehicle. 

Since I had sent these from my phone, I had opened the chart up in a new tab, looked at it (because I'd remembered the damage deficit of the LAW originally but not the specific #s for the others), then typed from memory in the first tab. 

I will grant that the LAW is faster to reload, *and*, vs. Tanks alone, I'd say that gives it the advantage, damage being roughly equivalent. 

However, in a given match, especially on Lancang Dam, Hainan Resort, Paracel Storm, Floodzone, and Shanghai, you'll run into **a lot** of other vehicles - LAVs, RHIB boats, Attack Boats, and Choppers. 

On maps like Hainan Resort, Shanghai, Floodzone, Dawnbreaker, Silk Road, and others I'm likely forgetting, there's quite a bit of veritcality as I mentioned in a couple other posts, where it's easy to get topside shots on Tanks and LAVs, resulting in critical damage bonuses for the SMAW and RPG, which the LAW doesn't get. How many rooftops and high hillsides and bridges are there, right? Lots. 

In these cases, the LAW is ***critically underpowered***. So, we can agree that for close range encounters the LAW is outputting near equal damage to the SMAW at a faster rate, against tanks. However, for all the other vehicles, the LAW has a significant damage deficit vs the other launchers, which make the SMAW and RPG the better universal solutions. 

Finally, firing anything beyond a short distance, the LAW becomes really squirrely. It doesn't fly as fast or straight as the SMAW, and the lock on mechanism fails to engage, even with a vehicle literally right in front of it. Sometimes, randomly, it *will* lock on, but it's highly inconsistent. Because of these factors, I can hit damn near anything with the fast, straight-flying SMAW, but outside of close range, the LAW is inconsistent and often misses. It's frustrating. :-/ 

The LAW is good for close combat, and the other launchers are more universal. The Javelin is pretty much useless now do to the unrealistic reconfiguring of the lock on mechanism, and the SRAW is a specialist weapon; if you are an expert with the SRAW, you are an AT GOD. "

CambodianDrywall,CFB,1389973739.0,"&gt;However, the latest game-winning score in a BCS NCG came from the Auburn Tigers in 2010. Cam Newton led the Tigers on a 7-play, 73-yard drive that sapped the final 2:33 worth of clock and ended with a Wes Byrum 19-yard field goal that broke the 19-19 tie in Auburn’s favor. Time ran out on the Ducks as the kick sailed through the uprights and War Eagle celebrated its first national championship since 1957.


Remember it like it was only yesterday.  Would have loved a shot in OT, but the game didn't break that way.  Quick shout-out to the Auburn fans that sat near us.  A classy and knowledgeable bunch.   "

Without seeing the system in question, it's hard to say anything about it generally.  A lot depends on where you make your power and how much power you're making.

It's a mysterious reddit thingy which happens often to spammers as well as those who use proxies, post from IP address ranges which have been banned by Reddit itself and/or post to controversial subs a lot. This is why your posts are not getting voted up, nobody can see them. The only people who can see them are either you or the mods of the sub you are posting to. I originally noticed this when I saw your post caught in the spam-trap (which happens automatically for ghosted accounts on most subs). I approved it and others can probably see it now but be aware that all future postings to pretty much all subs are likely to be invisible to all but you and the mods until the mods manually approve it, assuming they check the spam-trap regularly.

You can appeal to the reddit admins to have your account reinstated but it rarely works. I used to post as /u/nonsequitur1979 but got ghosted after I started posting in controversial subs (usually because of collectives of trolls who report you for stupid reasons and reddit's algorithms are rather unforgiving if you end up being the target of unwarranted mass-reporting). Try signing out and viewing your comment history and you'll see what I mean. Sign up with a new account and there's a good chance you'll be OK,  but be aware that if you are posting from a Reddit-wide banned IP range, you are likely to get ghosted again.

Brightt,relationship_advice,1389974013.0,"&gt; Also, should I be concerned that I had no strong emotional reaction to this? It's really not because I don't care. I just can't get myself hysterical over someone not wanting to be with me, even if I like them a lot. I get more upset by the idea that he probably wanted to end it for a while without me knowing and I acted foolishly.

Gonna disregard the other stuff and just answer this.

I'm someone who never has any strong emotional reactions to anything really. People often hold it against me (well people.. My SO and my mother) that they don't understand why I am so reserved in my emotions. I don't understand them to be honest, it only makes me more stable and I'm a happier person because of it.

I always weigh off emotions in terms of cost/benefit. I don't like being sad, nor do I like being mad. So I often just choose not to be mad/sad/upset and just be happy instead.

People tell me this is weird and unnatural, and I usually tell them they're idiots for letting petty emotions ruin their day. I'm always happy, I'm almost never sad and I like it that way.

You should be glad you can handle your emotions better than other people and don't let them ruin your stuff when they're not worth it."

Interesting theory! I mean, sure, market leaders tend to influence what we call product categories - any MP3 player was colloquially called an iPod, and many Americans call tissues Kleenex - but I've never heard someone refer to smartphones broadly as iPhones. Especially with Androids, with each OEM offering multiple phones within the same generation (Moto X vs. G, Galaxy Note 3 vs. S4 vs. S4 Active), declaring that one ""bought a Samsung"" could mean a number of devices.

But if I understand you correctly, you're essentially saying it comes down to brand recognition that's led Samsung to dominate the Android platform, rather than the actual merit of their devices? In theory, then, wouldn't say, a Samsung iOS device snag some major marketshare from Apple purely based on branding alone, or would we be in the same spot because people don't care about OS?"

wotmate,australia,1389974302.0,"I agree that shading and house design is important, but on these heatwave days, air con is still needed.  Massive amounts of energy is used to get the house cool, but with a solar-powered aircon, that runs all day, the house will be cool and not allow the external heat to seep into the internal walls.  On very hot days, the entire house becomes a thermal mass, so cooling it at the end of the day becomes that much harder.  Better to stop it from becoming a thermal mass to begin with.

I know what you mean about breezes, as this was the main reason for the design of the queenslander style home.  The verandah kept the sun off the walls, stopping them from becoming a thermal mass, and the main hallway was the breezeway, provided the house was situated correctly.  All of this is irrelevant if there's no breeze though.

As for the home insulation scheme, it was actually a success.  95% of homeowners that applied for it got exactly what they wanted.  It was the small amount of dodgy installers that made the headlines, and Labor handled it badly.  I actually know people that got it done, some of them in my family, and they couldn't be happier."

I started reading English books a few years ago to improve my grammars and the way I constructs sentences but this obviously doesn't help with the spoken part of the language.

I struggle with a lot of vowels actually, like a lot of French. I discovered like 1 year ago there are stress syllabes or something like that. An example I think every French folks will have problem with,(i found it in a comics where they were gently making fun of French) : how to pronounce bin, bean, or been. In the comic, the French character tried to explain he threw something in the bin, and everyone was trying to figure out what he was doing with a bean.

How so?

If I can mount my cell phone (a device used, ostensibly, primarily for business or entertainment) on my dash and use it (legally) for GPS, how is doing the same thing with Glass outside the law?

I'm not saying that it's *explicitly not* outside the law, rather that it is *not explicitly* outside the law, and that there's a strong parallel between using Glass (for certain purposes) while driving and other, legally-sound uses of a cellular phone (a device which *can* be used illegally while driving, but can also be used legally, for specific purposes and in specific ways).

At some point, either the courts or the lawmakers are going to have to decide on this. That, in and of itself, scares me, since neither politicians nor judges (far too many of whom are just politicians in robes, anymore) have anything resembling a proven track record of understanding, much less accepting, any technology that was not in existence 30 years ago. Whether or not I wind up agreeing with their eventual decision, however, the fact remains that the officer who issued this ticket had absolutely no grounds (based on current law) to do so based on current law if the device were turned off, and likely wouldn't have had any even if it had been on."

topgirlaurora,lifehacks,1389974565.0,"OP, I don't have any suggestions for how to not cry. My way is pretty obvious: I suck on something. Maybe a piece of candy would help, but you'd have to tell your girlfriend what you're doing so it doesn't look rude. It's gotta be the kind that sticks out of your mouth, like a lollipop or a candy cane. Take a guess why it works.

Oh. The other way to stop crying when you already are: wash your face with cold water. it shocks your system and stops the crying, mostly. My mom taught me that one, and I've taught it to my friends as I've grown up.

And as for the rampant sexism, keep your chin up, buddy. Being able to cry makes you more of a man than any of these cavemen. You're not weak, you have the strength to open up and be vulnerable. I've been trying to teach my boyfriend that it's okay to open up to me, even if it hurts, because that's the only way a relationship can last, is through communication and mutual trust.

My biggest advice to you (meaning what I wish someone told me when I started cooking) is pay close attention to the timing and prep of dishes. You don't want the steaks done before the water for the potatoes are boiling. You don't want to have to chop your onions when your garlic is starting to burn.

I have sorted them by user-rating so you can see what people recommend, although beware of films with high-ratings and a low number of votes. Also beware of more recent films, people tend to score newer films higher.
 
I have excluded films with less than 10,000 votes but if you click the link you can edit the URL to change that number, however it didn't change the most popular films, even when I set it to 100.

There's a lot of older films in there and some people have a strong aversion to older films, so [here](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?languages=fr&amp;num_votes=10000,&amp;release_date=1980-01-01,&amp;sort=user_rating,desc) is the same list as above but with only films made since 1980

The IMDB is a very useful website, although that usefulness has been hidden over the years. However, there are countless ways to filter films. If you want to find all the films made in a particular year or with a particular actor, or made in a particular format you can find it using the IMDB. The most powerful page is the [advanced search](http://www.imdb.com/search/title) where you can decide exactly what search query you can enter.

Reddit also has a search function, not as impressive but [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/awfoe/what_are_your_favourite_french_movies/) post asked the same question and so did [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bky86/what_are_your_favorite_french_films/) one"

You make it sound as if it's the government versus the corporations.  In reality the corporations are more often than not the ones controlling the government.  If anything it's the corporations verses the non-profits vying for control of the same government.

They often held seminars there on the following topics, quote from the article:

&gt; For three days, according to participants and audio recordings, thousands of Ugandans, including police officers, teachers and national politicians, listened raptly to the Americans, who were presented as experts on homosexuality. The visitors discussed how to make gay people straight, how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how “the gay movement is an evil institution” whose goal is “to defeat the marriage-based society and replace it with a culture of sexual promiscuity.”

There was even an hour long documentary about all this on Dateline (or one of those evening news shows) a few years back, which is also where I believe the famous ""eat da poo poo"" video clip gained fame. Of course they are all now saying they never intended their seminars and talks to lead to death penalty laws for gays, but that was still the end result."

I can't go in for a receptionist position with raggedy-assed hair, either.  If you want to get a position that had upward mobility (outside of fast food, that is), you have to dress the part.

Luckily, there are organizations like St. Vincent de Paul and even some women-centric organizations that collect donation and provide them to people for this very situation.

It's not good marketing if you have a highly successful console with a name everybody recognizes, then you throw a very similar name on a brand new console with newer hardware, as consumers who don't know the difference will in my opinion confuse the two, or think the Wii U is some add on for their Wii. 

EDIT: Let me clarify really quick. I had to sell these and you're hearing this purely from the ""family oriented gaming"" perspective. I had to explain the differences, and parents could not see any benefit purchasing another console like the Wii they already had. Even though I told them otherwise, in many cases people would think it was just some fancy add on to their Wii, not a console. That's just one thing I feel made a difference on their sales. You had stuff like the Wii fit, other products that were just attachments to their console.

Lyn_Never,TwoXChromosomes,1389975230.0,"I hear you - the sense of panicked urgency sucks so much, but the wheels don't necessarily turn urgently, unfortunately.  (On the other hand, this means you have some time to get qualified for assistance so you can afford it.)  It may depend on your state; I lived for a long time in an area where medical abortions were very rarely administered, either by Planned Parenthood or by private clinics.  

Part of the reason for that is that in a surgical procedure a doctor can determine that everything that needs to come out does come out.  With the pill, it's up to an untrained patient to determine that.  You could die if it doesn't complete, and that's a heavy legal liability for the prescriber.  Especially in a low-income situation where you might be reluctant to go to the emergency room or get follow-up help because of cost.

You will likely not use your insurance for just the test, especially during open testing hours.  Your insurance likely does not cover abortions, either, but honestly I would say don't start worrying about costs until someone tells you what they will be.  

PP charges entirely on a sliding scale based on ability to pay, which is where all the paperwork comes in, where you provide the information that allows them to calculate the cost to you.  They are accustomed to working this out for for-real-broke people, so let them guide you through that process.  It really doesn't work like a normal doctor's office.

Take any insurance documentation you have with you, but if you are on unemployment and/or food stamps or have any other sort of documentation of not having money (which is a weird thing to prove), take documentation of that with you as well. 

If they determined that you could get care somewhere else (or there) under your insurance, they would let you know that."

I was talking to 2 guys along the shore. They had just met as well. I requested the one guy to put his revolver away and that I'd put my mosin away. After giving them some supplies and talking to them for awhile, the guy I had eyes on drew his weapon. I started side strafing and he shot. He missed and I managed to get away unscathed.

All the other things I listed are also war crimes. Preemptive strikes are also considered ok under certain conditions, conditions that can be easily manipulated to fit just about any case. Our strike in Iraq was a preemptive war. The Six Day war is a commonly cited example of preemptive war. There have been no repercussions for either. In the case of Iraq all we had to do was claim the presence of WMDs and that is technically enough grounds for a preemptive strike. Calling it illegal makes no sense as it is permitted under certain circumstances of ""self-defense"" and the US has broken many international laws and has not and will never be prosecuted for them.

captain_craptain,pics,1389975305.0,"&gt; And if you have to stage a picture to convey that truth, that's not propaganda, it's not lying about what is essentially happening in Syria.

Staging anything is propaganda, no matter how altruistic or noble the goals of the propaganda may be.  You are setting up a special situation to be presented as genuine when it is not.  

&gt;The picture is a good job at composing the emotional reality about what is happening in Syria, and keeping the immediacy and urgency of these atrocities in our attention.  

Yes sure.  However this opinion is more that of an Art Director than that of someone looking at history and current events objectively.  

&gt;but it is true that Syrians are being brutally murdered on a vast scale by a vile government that has no right to exist.  

Truly fucked up on a grand scale, it is.  That government does have support though believe it or not.  There are people in that country who are behind Assad and his regime.  Sure most of them are from his tribe etc, but that is why they are fighting a civil war.  You can't say a government has no right to exist when there are people who give it [legitimacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_%28political%29).   

&gt;Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse. In political systems where this is not the case, unpopular régimes survive because they are considered legitimate by a small, influential élite.  

This is the case in Syria for the most part.   It seems like getting them kicked out of power should be a no-brainer right?  Not if the opposition is a bunch fractured and decentralized groups of people who all have different ideas about the future of the country and don't necessarily even like each other.  This is a major part of the reason they aren't getting much support from the West, even though Assad gets help from the Russkis.  If it were still pre-1985ish that would be a different story.  We don't want to appear that we are in bed with the wrong opposition groups which we undoubtedly would be, and most likely are already.  It's reminiscent of the Russians' war in Afghanistan, where we helped the Taliban and now we fight them.  

My point is, the level of safety for kids over there is SNAFU.  That video you posted of all the dead kids is a perfect example.  Who knows who actually killed these kids with the shelling.  It is war, there are going to be collateral damage casualties.  I find it strange that they always gather groups of dead children and parade them around like props.  It is similar to people dancing on the graves of the dead Newtown kids to draw attention to something they want done, only in a much more grotesque manner.  These people want more support from the west, so they do this.  Is it not entirely possible that some of those kids were killed by forces friendly to them or on the Rebel's side and were added into the video anyway to make it look better?    

The bottom line is they are setting up the situation to make it shocking and to get people like you all riled up and in a lather about this war.  That is propaganda, plain and simple.  It's not always wrong, but to say something that is clearly propaganda, isn't, is just dishonest.  "

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389975416.0,"We're doing plastic, simply because of costs.  I asked each of the caterers what their disposables were like, so I could be sure it wasn't chinet or something.

If you can afford real plates, I'd do that because they're more durable and regardless of what kind of wedding you're having (from casual to black tie), real-plates are fine.  However, if you're having a very fancy affair, I think real plates are your only option.  Maybe even china.

AdamColligan,books,1389975431.0,"I think there are two problems with the idea presented here:

1. The Common Core, which I'll admit I'm not an expert on, is not really the culprit when it comes to dissecting literature into unlovable fragments. The kinds of things that you get standardized-tested on when it comes to reading comprehension are generally both (a) important skills to get on top of fostering a ""love for reading"" and (b) already being pushed by state and local systems independently of the development of the Common Core. So you have to do some cookie-cutter things with identifying imagery, symbolism, etc.

2. I really learned to hate a lot of classic books in school growing up, and I went through a relatively very excellent public school system that had very little standardized testing pressure at all. The problem that I think I encountered the most was simply that the class discussions often were not able to leap out of the mechanics of the literature and the tick-tock of the story. The class needs to really get at (a) the *ideas* that the author is expressing and/or (b) the *connection* between how we see things now and how the book sees them. Literature needs to be connected better with history and needs to be understood better *as* history. 

Maybe this is a bit hard to explain, but I'll take an example of something many people had to read, like Pale Horse, Pale Rider. It's important to develop the skill of interpreting that story's imagery, connecting it with tropes in literary traditions, etc. It's also important -- and facile, I guess -- to learn the background of the 1918 Pandemic Flu and go ""oh, see, it's set against the background of that event"".  But there should be something a lot more there that I did not understand until later, almost until I was done with high school. There should be this whole layer of ""this is a record of how a creative person living in that time, with the war and the epidemic and the culture being what you learned in history class, expressed their consciousness of love and death. How is that different to how we might think about love and death now? How did expressions like this maybe even change the way people thought about love, leading to how we feel it and express it today?""  There is this whole beautiful tension between the knowledge that people are basically the same as they have always been and the knowledge that our perception of everything -- philosophical, aesthetic, personal, political -- has changed so radically, maybe the whole idea of what it means to be conscious is really different. Classic literature should be how we explore that basic conundrum, how we learn to receive deep, personal messages from the past and send them, along with our own, into the future, all the while wondering whether the gulf of time is really a barrier to intimately understanding each other or not. 

To the extent that the teaching of literature for me missed that -- and too often became about surface-level statements like ""you have to see that the Bennett family is really poor and stuff, and marriage is sort of about social and financial survival"" -- I don't really blame the curriculum.  The curriculum provided for all the things that you really can make it provide for. What great literature needs is an exceptional teacher, and I think the anecdotal evidence here is that most people (including me) did get at least one during their time in school. You need a teacher who understands enough of history and philosophy outside of textbook lists of literary methods and tropes, and you also need a teacher who is bold enough to raise really difficult questions about very sensitive topics that come up in literature. Partly that's about things that are politically or socially sensitive now, like sex or racism. But even more than that, I think it's about being able to raise things that are personally, existentially sensitive -- how we experience loss, ambition, the desire to be good, or just what it's like to be alive, and whether it's the same for everybody. This is really hard to do, and I don't think our society can be blamed for not being replete with super-talented people who want nothing more than to teach this over and over for a middling wage. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that plenty of classic literature just isn't all that engaging to lots of students. God knows I tried reading &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt; years after high school, thinking that school had ruined it for me, only to discover that I actually just couldn't stand the prose and didn't care much for the story. 

At some point, students have to be shown how to use literature to connect with people and ideas, or they have to learn for themselves. The kinds of comprehension and structural tools that you'll get tested on may not be the be-all and end-all, and it would be a real shame if schools deliberately stopped there in order to re-emphasize them to boost test scores. But they are a necessary part of the journey to grasping great literature, and there are bigger barriers than the Common Core or accountability systems in general between disinterested, disengaged students and very difficult epiphanies regarding humanity."

SumoSizeIt,apple,1389975529.0,"&gt;The clone market for Macs nearly killed Apple, but I think Apple's in a very different place now and iOS devices represent a very different portion of the market than Macs did at the time. 

Excellent point, and I think part of what's led to Apple's recovery and rise to stardom has been that they recognized the importance of a consistent user experience.

&gt; I don't think it would thus hurt Apple's growth (as much as you might think).

I know they aren't a fan of anyone trying to modify that experience (Psystar, hackintoshes, jailbreaking, etc) - in some ways that makes their emphasis on consistency a crutch as well as a strength, because without that, they might suffer the same fragmentation and inter-platform competition that others face.

But I think you're right that it wouldn't hurt them too much - we see Samsung far above the likes of HTC, Motorola, and others within the Android-sphere, we'd probably see the same trend with Apple if iOS was a shared platform, with them high among the ranks of hypothetical alternate iOS OEMs, though I have to wonder how close on their heels Samsung would be."

As far as we know it was taken to Essos by Bittersteel after Daemon Blackfyre fell in battle and I would imagine that the subsequent pretenders have continued to wield it up until the death of Maelys the Monstrous. So doesn't it actually sound like a really bad idea to give Blackfyre to Aegon if he is trying to pass as a legitimate Targaryen?"

I was with him at one of those high end-bars with classy decor and lots of cool lighting. We spot two honeys and start chatting them up. We spend an hour or so with them but it's pretty clear that I haven't sparked any interest. My friend, however, hit it off with one of the girls from the start and as we all got up to split, he managed to convince her to follow him home. Me and the other girl went separate ways so that's where the first-person part of my account ends.

At the time, my friend lived 40 mins away by train, a rickety old local line which starts from one of the city's universities. The girl lived in the opposite direction and hadn't realized how far away he was, so she was about to end the night when he convinced her they should just fuck right there on the campus entrance lawn. The grass was pretty muddy so he threw down his overcoat and off they went to Humpsville.

Halfway through, his condom broke but he was all ""fuckit"" and kept going without the rubber. Soon he finished but misjudged the timing and sprayed all over his coat. That was pretty bad but he's the kind of guy who laughs shit like that off so he just picked it up. That's when he realized there wasn't as much mud on the grass as there was dogshit. Just obscene amounts, as if an entire kennel had taken taken a break there after having dogfood burritos. And it had smeared all over the other, jizz-free side of his coat.

Red wines will last longer than white wines, and wines with a higher ABV will last longer. You can age reds for several decades, whites only a couple of years. (In general, there are exceptions.)

Hoppy beers will not age well at all. Lagers don't age that well either. In both cases I'd say you have about a year. Some big beers (Belgian Strong, Imperial Stouts) actually benefit from a little aging, but it all depends on how they were bottled. Typically bottle conditioned strong beers (high ABV with the yeast) will do well with a few years of aging. The most I'd go is about 5 years on a vintage Belgian style, but that's because I don't have full/proper climate control in my beer room yet."

BeachBumHarmony,cringepics,1389975834.0,"Ugh... reminds me of when I walked into a real life version of Jerry Springer. I was visiting a friend, Lisa, who I knew from our summer town. She would stay with her Grandma during the summer a couple blocks away and we became friends. 

So, I realized that Lisa would stay with her grandma growing up for stability. 

She was from a very redneck/hick area. She was living with her boyfriend, Jay, at the time and I was going to stay on the couch. Her boyfriend had made plans to go to a bar with a friend, Adam, letting us have a girls' night in the little one bedroom apartment.

So, we go and get some liquor and are starting the party when my friend's boyfriend calls and say they are making a pit stop at the apartment. 

And I hear the whole crazy story:

Adam is out on bail. He knows he is guilty and is going to jail for a long time for vehicular manslaughter. He killed a guy with his car while driving drunk. 

Adam is also determined to use this free time to fuck as many women as possible, before he gets locked up. 

The problem? Adam's baby momma, Wendy. Wendy was/is hopelessly in love with Adam. Adam does not want to be with Wendy and Wendy can't get it through her head that Adam just wants to fuck random girls before he gets locked up. So, what do Wendy do? She uses their son as a pawn and doesn't let Adam see his boy unless she's there too. 

So, somehow, Adam and Jay decide to stay with Lisa and I. Wendy keeps texting Adam and he tells her where he is. So, Wendy comes over and we all get drunk. Their son is safely at Wendy's parents house. Wendy, with more and more liquor, keeps getting touchy-feely with Adam and Adam keeps trying to shrug her off. She keeps getting more and more pissed as Adam rejects her. After a while, Adam goes for a walk to cool off. We all hear an engine start. Wendy and Jay run like mad to see Adam leaving and driving Jay's truck. Wendy started yelling like a mad women, cursing and screaming, and throws a beer at Jay's truck. When Lisa hears Wendy yelling, she takes off as well, concerned because the landlord lives upstairs and has kids (it's past midnight). The landlord hears Wendy and sees Lisa and is pissed. So, when Jay, Wendy, and Lisa come back into the apartment, Lisa throws Wendy against the wall and screams in her face about how it's all her fault and she doesn't think about anyone other than herself. Wendy then left.

And I just sat on the couch, drinking my malibu, thinking about how happy I was to be returning to college the next day. 

TL;DR: I sat and watched a real-life Jerry Springer episode.

AnthonyG23,detroitlions,1389975910.0,"I'm not falling for it. 

This is what **we** as typical Lions fans do - we looked at the facts and formed the opinion (many of us) that they did not do their due diligence and hence did not hire the best person for the job.  

Then, after a simple press conference (which is always just hyperbole), we as fans decide that the guy is the next Vince Lombardi.  If you recall the Rod Marinelli press conference - it sounded very similar to Caldwell.  

Here's the deal - I personally think Jim Caldwell is an okay coach. But, in the NFC North, one of the toughest divisions in the NFL, the Lions had to hit a home run with this hire.  You could make a case for that even more now since the Vikings have hired Zimmer with Norv Turner as his O.C. 

The Lions now likely have the 3rd or 4th best coaching staff in the division.  And, we have this coaching staff at a critical time for Matt Stafford's development as well as during the prime of Calvin Johnson's career.  

I'll always support this team and I hope on wrong about this hire. But, in my opinion they swung and missed and it's going to result in more years of SOL mediocrity.

I had the SCS implanted a week ago and it is helping quite a bit. Work with the doc to help set your expectations for relief. I'll probably always need medication but the hope is to reduce the need by about 50%. So far so good!

Have you tried restorative yoga or standing qigong? I have done both along with walking (on good days) and general strength training to help support the muscles around my spine. When I am cleared I will be adding in swimming and walking in the pool. 

If you are carrying a few extra pounds try and get rid of them. When I am closer to my ""ideal weight"" I have fewer problems with my back and legs, I have more good days. I am currently trying to get back to my goal weight after having a baby. Every pound I drop makes me feel a little better. 

I started getting massages about a year after my ALIF and they are awesome. It's short term relief but hey, it feels nice. 

I have also used medical marijuana and it is wonderful. The only reason I don't use it now is because I have a little baby and teen agers in the house, also a months supply of mmj is way more expensive than the opiates my insurance covers. 

Good luck and keep putting one foot in front of the other and moving forward. "
I_Enjoy_Taffy,bostonceltics,1389975959.0,"The way I see it there's a few options:

1. Rondo has his minutes monitored the rest of the season (or until we've lost enough for it to not matter if we win a few games here and there). This way you get to showcase his abilities to potential suitors or to get him into game shape.

2. They ease him back into the lineup and they let him play a normal amount of minutes for 15-20 games to boost his trade value and show that he is indeed healthy enough to play for another team. You've got to realize Rondo has the remainder of this season and all of next season left on his contract. So if Danny is serious about trading Rondo (which I personally think he is based on all past trade talks involving him) this is the best chance and pretty much the last time he will get a chance to. If you let the trade deadline pass and he's still on the team then his trade value has significantly diminished because any team trading for him is basically renting him for one year. Plus, I think Rondo is gonna demand a max contract and I don't think the Celtics are willing to give him one. Sell high on him while you can, before it's too late.

3. He plays well enough that suddenly we're too good to have a desirable draft position. This is the worst case scenario."

tangerinelion,politics,1389975998.0,"It's Wal\*Mart that warns (local/state) government when they are thinking of building a new store that they need certain criteria in order to build it.

In reality it costs them the opportunity to have more jobs rather than actually removing existing jobs.  The latter, however, would happen if a store closed.

Jooceman's point is that the new jobs Wal\*Mart may bring to an area are actually not worth it at all.  So rather than bending the business laws to encourage Wal\*Mart to build a new store politicians should be telling them to go stuff themselves and trying to get CostCo, etc., to build a store for the area (enticing if they already know Wal\*Mart isn't interested).

It has absolutely nothing to do with whether you or anyone else shops there.  That's only the thing which keeps the stores in business, it's not the thing that causes stores to be built and new jobs to be created (though once they are, obviously shopping there keeps the jobs filled)."

Last time, i was in the great ape house, happen to make eye contact with an orangutan directly on the other side of the glass. She had the saddest look in her eyes. I know animal emotions are often minimized or denied (probably so we dont have to feel bad), but you cant deny that looking into the eyes of some animals is very different from others. She held my gaze for a long moment, turned her back and sat still with shoulders hunched, head hung. Another orangutan came over with a blanket, like a security blanket, gave it to her and then put an arm around her, seemingly trying to comfort her. After a moment the sad looking orangutan pulled the blanket over her head and flopped on her side like a depressed person. 

I suddenly felt ashamed of being human. Felt embarrassed (and kinda do now even telling you guys) but could barely hold back tears. In my experience, many people think its weird or silly to have empathy toward another species, but I think its weird humans can be so cruel to them.

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1389976121.0,"When people ask about how the birth of my son went, I have to offer them a warning. It was rather strenuous, and both him and my wife nearly died in the process. Truth be told, a great deal of it is hard to remember. Labor lasted for nearly 32 hours before our obstetrician made the call for an emergency c-section. The little guy had gotten stuck, and complications had caused a great deal of internal bleeding. They had me put on a surgical gown and mask so I could be in there with her.

I never really saw what went down behind the surgical curtain. It was more important for me to be up at eye level with my wife. She was scared to death for both our son's safety and hers as well. A team of surgeons worked diligently to repair the damage and get our kid out safely, and I told her stories to keep her calm between bouts of unconsciousness. 

It was almost too much to process at the time. I was simultaneously on the brink of either meeting my firstborn son or losing my family before it even began. I'm not entirely sure how I managed to keep it together.

Whey will make you fart like crazy. I'm not a fan. Hemp isn't bad, and is complete protein.

I've been lifting for a while without shakes -- it's harder at first to get enough protein, but eventually you figure out what you need to eat in order to get enough, and what swaps you can make to get more (greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt, for example). 

Chicken is a godsend -- and butchers who will grind up chicken so it's more like ground beef are awesome (chicken gets tiresome after a while; grinding it completely changes it so you feel you're eating something else).

b-monster666,firstworldanarchists,1389976334.0,"I've always made the argument that artists and the actual game developers are unfairly paid by the industry.

In the music industry, the artists earn their largest profits from touring and merchandise.  Very little from music sales makes it to their pockets.  A hefty chunk of the cost goes to the retailer, another chunk goes to the distributor, another chunk goes to the producer...none of these provided any talent for the artist.  Too many middlemen cut too deeply into the artists' pockets.  Unless, of course, the artist owns their own distribution, which is rare for most.

The same thing happens with movies.  As pointed out by [Hollywood Economics](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/magazine/how-does-the-film-industry-actually-make-money.html?_r=0).  In this case, actors and workers are hired by the shell corporation of the studio, who are budgeted by the studio itself, and wind up ""costing"" more than what the film takes in.  Lord of the Rings may have cost Wingnut $500m to make, it earned Warner Brothers $1b, but ""Wingnut"" is still ""out"" $500m.  Then, when it comes to DVD sales, those are distributed by Warner Brothers, and all the profits go to them, and not to Wingnut.  So, anyone who had a stake in the profits from Wingnut are left out in the cold.  And, it's the distributors who earn the cash, and not the people who worked on it.

Then there's the whole TV media distribution scam.  Distributors, like NBC, charge providers, like Rogers Cable fees for airing their station, and with that comes the programming.  Rogers makes up that fee by charging the consumer.  But, it doesn't end there.  Commercial stations also earn money by charging advertising slots.  Its this advertising revenue that generates the revenue to provide funding for programs.  So, distributors like NBC get paid double for program availability.  But, the talent that work on the production only get paid a set fee.  Once a show has aired, it has earned as much as it can to cover the cost of production, and paid for the talent.  Subsequent airings of the program are just gravy for the distributors, and the talent earns nothing from it.

So, what does downloading a song do?  Or downloading a movie that's been released to DVD do?  Or downloading a TV show after it's been aired to?  It takes money out of the distributors' hands, which rightfully belongs in the artists' hands."

candydaze,Christianity,1389976438.0,"Your comment about the prologue of John's gospel is interesting - I've always loved that passage, as I think it sums up what I believe in as much as can be done through mere words. 

The church I attended a kid used to have a carol service with 9 readings, starting with Adam and Eve being cast out of the garden, through Isaiah's prophecy and the Christmas story. The climax of the service (if you like) was the final reading - the prologue to the gospel of John. The lights were dimmed, and the reading would have this mystical quality to it. It was always incredibly moving for me."

&gt;By posting on this forum, your inetnion is clear.

oh really so everyone by virtue of posting has the same intention do they? or do you mean the ""content"" of the posts.

Kind of ironic that someone claiming to have cogent and articulate arguments can't spot the hypocrisy of the two points you made (assuming you don't mean the first possibility, which is particularly easy to show to be erroneous )

likewise:

&gt;The point I was making is that it your responsibility to communicate clearly, not everyone else's to discern your muddled thought.

It really does take a special brand of stupid to think failure to communicate is the limiting factor in someone else's comprehension.

 i hate to break it to you but it certainly isn't my responsibility to extend effort and consideration to make up the shortfall of people simply too stupid or incompetent to understand basics.

I think you have confused me with a teacher or someone who has a duty to inform and educate rather than someone wishing to not waste his time walking children their massive logical flaws


&gt;See how this works? I attempt to say something. It is ill-recieved by someone who isn't too bright. Do I throw a hissyfit, or do I calmly restate my position so that an idiot can understand it?

Here is hoping you can see the logical hypocrisy of that comment, but i very much doubt it.

AdamColligan,AskReddit,1389976530.0,"I know, right?

When I was maybe 14 or so, I went to Aviation Challenge at Space Camp in Alabama. There are several parts of the week that involve escape and evasion, and one of them is a team exercise. You have to sort of crawl through the woods and facility together, trying not to get caught, or at least trying not to get caught doing anything that would make you more likely to get caught if the counselors hunting you were, I dunno, the Serbian army or something.

Anyway, I was supposedly the leader of this team, and they told us in advance that they would try to infiltrate our ranks or steer us wrong with bullshit lies, and we were not to listen or to accept outsiders -- maybe they would be other kids who had been caught out. There were one or two counselors in charge of safety or whatnot, and they were wearing Cartman shirts, and it was only their authorahtai that we were supposed to respect. Otherwise, we were not to say a word. 

So my team gets held up at some point, and I go up and try to figure out what's going on, and there's this counselor and maybe some kid from another team, and they're frantically telling us to stop and go around another way. I'm all WTF, and they're like ""seriously, dude, there is a skunk, *right there*, and it's mad, and you need to go off the path"". I have this memory of being on my hands and knees, lips zipped, at the head of a column of muddy tweens, looking into the face of a looming 20-something and just slowly and seriously shaking my head, refusing to budge or to follow them to the trap / location of alleged skunk.

They had to dispatch a runner to go get Cartman to explain to me that there really was an angry skunk, narrowly averting the need for the entire camp having to spend the next three days sharing quarters with a fully thiolated Team Warthog. "

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389976594.0,"&gt;So I’m going to suggest we contribute the same percentage of what we earn.

This makes the most sense.  It's really the only thing that's fair to me in a long term relationship.  Imagine he makes triple what you do.  That means when you do anything, go anywhere, own anything, he's going to have an easier time paying.  He can afford more, and will likely want to do more.  Should you hold him back because you make less?  Should you go broke to keep up?

Think of any example.  You want to go on vacation.  He can afford Europe, you can afford driving a couple states away for a hotel and some nice activities.  Should you have to give up Europe just because he can afford it and you can't?  Or do you go and worry about how much in debt it's going to put you just so you can keep up with him?

Plus, it's fair - you still have to compromise, but everything is proportional.  For example, let's say you can afford $600 in rent and he can afford $1200.  That means when looking for a place, your budget is $1800.  Anything up until that is fine, and whatever it ends up being, you split based on your respective incomes.

If you want to see how ridiculous it is not to do this, let's say he makes $1,000,000/year and you make $50,000.  You want to buy a house - do you go halfsies and buy a small house, or do you get something more along the lines of what *he* can afford?

tangerinelion,politics,1389976639.0,"The ironic thing is the rich are better off if the lower and middle classes are wealthier.  But instead they're more interested in having a pissing contest amongst themselves.

Wages which don't keep pace with cost-of-living ultimately lead to fewer purchases, leading to lower production, and therefore higher unemployment.  All of this spirals, as the stock market starts to crash.  Some of the investors will necessarily lose money, others will take advantage and change their long positions to short and actually become even wealthier.

Now the other problem with a large inequality is that the poorest people effectively spend every dollar they earn.  The middle class still spends most of what they take in - many are able to save something, but even 10% is probably high.  So figure over 90% of the income of the lower and middle class is spent.

Then look at the wealthy.  Yes, they buy expensive stuff.  But they're also really interested in wealth accumulation, so if they make $1M/yr in income, they're going to have a hard time spending $900k of that.  

Which all means that as the income inequality increases you have *less* money being spent in total.  Which is more or less what the ""economy"" is."

This all depends on if you want to keep the carbonation in the beer. The more air volume in a large beer bottle, the more carbonation will escape while it sits. Which is why it's to your advantage to buy small bottles and drink them all gone. 

The biggest enemy of wine is oxygen. Prevent oxygen from getting to the wine and you've met your goal. 

For wine, you can [buy an inert gas](http://www.amazon.com/Enthusiast-Private-Preserve-Preservation-Spray/dp/B0000DCS18/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389976904&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wine+saver+gas) to spray in there before you recork it. It's sometimes expensive though. $25 for about 50 squirts. But the heavier gas displaces oxygen so your wine stays fresh. Those vacuum pumps don't work. I've tried them. (I might even try the canned air for cleaning computers, since it's also inert. Nitrogen I think.)



Also in this case, finishing a small bottle of wine is preferable to leaving a larger bottle open and recorked.

taonzen,freemasonry,1389976909.0,"From [Masonic Myths](http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/masonic_myths.html):

&gt;More recently, the adoption of the blue forget-me-not by Nazi-era freemasons is another myth. The Grand Lodge zur Sonne (Bayreuth) used to have a pin made for delegates to wear to their annual meetings. One particular pin, in 1926, depicted a forget-me-not. Later, in 1934, the Nazis instituted the Winterhilfswerk, which involved youths collecting money on the streets for rearmament. To encourage donations, different pins and badges were given to contributors for them to wear during that collection period. The badge used by the Nazis for the collection made in March 1938 coincidently was the same forget-me-not pin chosen by the freemasons in 1926. There is absolutely no record of the pin, or the flower, ever having been worn during the war anywhere in Germany much less in concentration camps, as the legend would have it.

&gt;The Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of Germany, Dr. Theodor Vogel distributed the same pin as a token of friendship whenever he made official visits abroad after 1948; most notably at a Conference of Grand Masters in Washington, DC in February 1953, where he recounted the 1938 history.

&gt;This explains how the blue forget-me-not became a German masonic emblem after the war and why, when American freemasons later founded military lodges in Germany, at least one chose that flower as the lodge name. Many lodges in Germany, at least up until recently, present a forget-me-not to newly raised brethren or Master Masons. "

 One: People aren't wearing enough hats.
  
Two:  Matter is energy. In the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person's soul. However, this ""soul"" does not exist ab initio as orthodox Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia.

if you go to a large college with intelligent people you'll experience very suddenly and quickly a complete shift in autonomy and a humbling, but deeply enjoyable sense of not having to cope with your surroundings by developing an ugly sense of superiority.  in my experience, pushing yourself to get into a good college is a worthwhile endeavor purely for the opportunity to be in the company of other smart people.

I am *not* ""on the fence"" about the question of god's existence, any more than I am ""on the fence"" about the value of X in the equation of a + b + c = X; without knowing the value of the other variables, I have insufficient information to answer the question. My agnosticism is not me ""not being able to make up my mind"", it is me refusing to believe or disbelieve in something I cannot know with a certainty.

And while I respect and generally lean in favor of athiests who point out that the existence of a god is extremely unlikely, for me personally ""extremely unlikely"" isn't enough for me to feel comfortable with making that leap to assuming something definitively doesn't exist.

Christopher Hitchens talks about being agnostic about god in the same way he's agnostic about fairies, and I would say I feel much the same way. The difference is that I don't definitively say fairies don't exist either. I just say that they very likely do not exist, and leave it at that.

positmylife,childfree,1389977071.0,"Here is my story: I was always apprehensive about having a child (I'm a girl btw). The whole thing seemed odd to me and the amount and size of needles involved in child birth freaked me the hell out (because I have a specific phobia of needles). As a kid, I'd always say I didn't want kids. Everyone told me I was silly and would change my mind. I figured they were right. I'd grow out of my fears and be a big girl and deal with needles.

Well, the older I got, the more girls around me started babysitting. They were all good with kids. I sucked at it. I hated babysitting. My mom kinda pushed me to babysit though and the cash was nice since I hadn't had a job before. I met my ex junior year of high school. Being the naive high schooler raised on fairy tales, I thought we were in love and decided we were going to get married someday. Eventually kids came up and I told him I was afraid of having kids and would only be able to struggle through one, maybe two. He wanted, and this is almost a literal quote, to have as many kids as The Lord allows. Like, keep having kids until your fertility ends. 19 kids and counting sort of ideal. I was shocked he was at such an extreme end of the spectrum, but I decided I would just have to get over it because that's what you do when you love someone. 

Over time, little bits and pieces started coming out that made me more and more uncomfortable. I was an honors student heading to college and planning for law school. He finally revealed he wanted me to be a stay at home mom for our bajillion kids. He wanted a career that would take him on the road a lot too, so he was planning on leaving me for weeks at a time to manage our herd myself. We fought about this a lot because I could see the future I had planned for myself slowly slipping away. At the same time, I was trying to convince myself it would be okay. I would love my children so much that it would be worth it right? Maybe being busy with them would help me forget he was always gone. Something magical will happen when I have my first kid that will make me into an excellent mother. It was frightening how hard I tried to convince myself I was ok with this.

Then my current boyfriend walks into my life. Back when we were just friends, the topic of kids came up when rowdy kids would be in the area. He mentioned how he didn't want kids. I didn't believe him because literally every guy I knew and ever crushed on wanted children. He must be exaggerating. He was completely serious. He didn't hate kids, but he didn't want to be around them either. That was a game changer for me. It planted the seed that I really did have a choice. There were people out there who wouldn't force me to bear their children. It wasn't the only factor that lead me to eventually end a relationship that was totally wrong for me, but it was a big one. My biggest fear was giving him the kids he wanted and being left to raise them like a single mother or have him cheat on me while he was on the road and deal with the fallout. Now I'm with a lovely gentleman who doesn't want kids and encourages me to live the life I want. It's taken sometime to dispel the ""desire"" for children I convinced myself I had, but he's been patient and I know now more than ever that I am completely content to be childless myself while I spoil his nieces and nephews rotten.

foamster,books,1389977255.0,"I enjoyed reading ASoIaF more than tLotR. Tolkien is very straight-forward. Here's the ring, there's the bad guys, let's get this thing done. GRRMartin has done a number of different things with his writting style. By using various first-person accounts, he's able to view certain situations through different lenses. Two characters might interperate events differently, even conflictingly, and it's left up to the reader to determine what may or may not be the 'correct' truth. Lord of the Rings is a very 'Disney' story, in that the main players end up heroes in the end, and everybody lives happily ever after... A Song of Ice and Fire is not a 'happy' story.. but it will make you think, and it will make you *feel*, and it will **shock** you. It's my single favorite work of fiction and it's not even complete yet. 

Something to keep in mind, though: 

The first two books, in general, set the stage for the wild events of book three. The fourth and fifth books do the exact same thing to an even greater degree, moving somewhat slowly, providing a huge volume of interlocking plot threads.. but the upcoming sixth book should be a *good* one. (:"

Jardun,graphic_design,1389977293.0,"I feel like I see a thread about Graphic Design books almost weekly. Maybe using the search function is a skill only some aquire. Anyway, here is what I have posted before, which I think is a really good list of basic books for beginners and professionals alike: (ofc there are other great books out there too, but I own and like these)

&gt; These are all books that I absolutly love, and bought for either personal use or to accompany different courses while I was getting my BFA in GD. I have seen some of them both are brick and mortar book stores, and college book stores. If you get a chance to see them in person before buying, leaf through them to get a feel.
&gt; 
&gt; * [Megg's History of Graphic Design](http://www.amazon.com/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/0470168730), absolutely essential to understanding where graphic design comes from historically. IMO the best GD history book on the market, at least the most encompassing. One of my favorites, was very helpful writing different papers and researching historical styles.
&gt; 
&gt; * [Graphic Design School](http://www.amazon.com/New-Graphic-Design-School-Foundation/dp/0470466510/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389205349&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=graphic+design+school). Another great book, focuses more on design process and stuff like that. This one more walks you though being a designer. Gives tutorials on different things too, which is useful.
&gt; 
&gt; * [Graphic Design Referenced](http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Referenced-Bryony-Gomez-Palacio/dp/1592537421/ref=pd_sim_b_14) is a really great book that is a bit of a hybrid. This book describes a lot of design terms, styles, and general knowledge while referring to historical and modern examples.
&gt; 
&gt; Those three for me are really essential books for new graphic designers, I learned more from those three than I can express. Below are a few more books I really like, but might be a bit more advanced than someone just getting started might want.
&gt; 
&gt; * Another book I have used a lot, and almost included with those three is above. [Thinking with Type](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=pd_sim_b_2). Really great intro into typography.
&gt; 
&gt; More advanced even.

Anyway, the violinist is a person who has already been conscious and has a self identity, while the fetus never really ""existed"" before. If you don't define a fetus as a ""person"" to begin with, the analogy doesn't really hold up, no matter what your opinion is on the subject, because you're really arguing apples and oranges.

In order for this argument to remain relevant, you have to assume that the fetus is a person on which we should have to confer rights, while I do not believe this to begin with. It's a ""human"", but seeing how it doesn't, and NEVER had the brain functions to make a person a person, it's impossible to actually empathize with it, since from its own standpoint, it NEVER existed."

To answer your actual question:  the whole situation was a giant standoff.  If the Church perceived them as coming in full force, they'd start firebombing the town.  If the Doctor thought there was too much of a threat, he'd bring back the Time Lords.  Making more than small intrusions would ignite a war that none of them wanted.  If they wanted to, they'd could have all attacked at once, but then Gallifrey would have been brought back and everything would have gone to shit.  **NOBODY** wants The Last Great Time War vol. 2:  Revengeance."

attax,LSAT,1389977492.0,"I think it depends on the school at that point. Of course it matters all else being equal, but I think that if you are sub median on anything is where softs come in. Of course this is speculation, but at least this cycle it seems to be true. I think you can't simply quantify intelligence. If that were the case a 3.7 would mean more coming from, say, University of Chicago compared to a 3.7 from Kansas Community College. Both are impressive, but not so sure you can directly compare the two as truly being of equal intelligence just via their GPA. 

Hence why I think once you are below, your softs can really make a difference. A 2.75 with solid softs would beat a 3.3 with mediocre softs given all other numbers are even at some place like Texas with a median around 3.6ish. Softs speak more to your abilities than a mere GPA does when not being considered for ranking ability."

German and French clubs always have some african players in their youth setups, so you can always have your scout check them out.

If you still want to scout Africa, keep yourself to these nations: Morocco, Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Tunisia, South Africa and Senegal. I'd highlight Nigeria and Ivory Coast as the nations with more potential, and clubs like Eniymba, Kano Pillars (both from Nigeria), Coton Sport (Cameroon), and ASEC (Ivory Coast) as the ones I've had more luck with.

ebonlance,Warmachine,1389977651.0,"Nah, go for it. People saying Cyriss blows if you fuck up activation order are exaggerating. They're not that advanced, it's just that their vectors greatly benefit from going in a certain order and staying within 6 inches of each other. Order of activation is something you'll need to perfect with any faction, but Cyriss still has perfectly viable warjacks even if you don't include the free focus they can get.

If anything the hardest part about playing Cyriss is matching battlegroups to casters when coming up with lists. Each caster wants a very different battlegroup, compared to factions like Cryx or Khador where you can use a very similar battlegroup from caster to caster most of the time.

The other part is missing models. In April we will finally have almost all of our faction out, except for our ridiculously good battle engine and arguably the most important solo in the faction. You should probably get used to the idea of proxying that solo because he makes our infantry pretty bonkers."

I heard Santorinis Pizza is good. My boss just recently ate there. I don't know if they deliver or not. 

Tutta Bella is reasonably close but I did not personally care for it. I'd eat there over going to Pizza Hut or Rominos though. 

Papa Murphy's is good if you want to bake the pizza yourself. They are near the Grocery Outlet.

I dunno, no one speaks the Old English dialect any more and it's a chore to read. Give me a quote from the NIV any day. 

I totally agree with the verses though! I've just met too many people who just assumed the Bible is still in King James format only and that's why they don't read it or have never read it because they've never understood it.

ljak,Judaism,1389977947.0,"Gilguls in Eastern European Yiddish culture are actually very similar to the Hindu concept of reincarnation in that it can refer to actual rebirths (Kabbalists believe that great Jewish souls, like that of Moses, are reborn in each generation) as well as something like being temporarily possessed by a ghost.

In Yiddish folklore, the way to get rid of such possessions is to give the ghost the thing that they were denied in their life, like a proper (symbolic) burial, a conversation with a great Rabbi, a return of a lost item, etc.

Unlike in India, these reincarnations were always treated with extreme caution, and belief in them was not encouraged. That is, Jews believed that they happened, but that thinking about them too much would only strengthen the effect, which was seen as undesirable. By the way, the same thing applies to dreams: they were viewed as being potentially prophetic, but what ends up happening depends on the interpretation of the dream that the dreamer chooses to believe in.

You can read many stories about Gilguls in collections of Yiddish folklore. I can recommend **[one such collection by Beatrice Weinreich](http://www.amazon.com/Yiddish-Folktales-Library-Classics/dp/0805210903)**, but there are many others which may have relevant material. I've been recommended these two:

* [Leaves from the Garden of Eden: One Hundred Classic Jewish Folktales](http://www.amazon.ca/books/dp/0195335651)
* [Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism](http://www.amazon.ca/Tree-Souls-Mythology-Howard-Schwartz/dp/0195327136/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376679452&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Tree+of+Souls%3A+The+Mythology+of+Judaism )"

Nobody is doubting some missionaries are fighting for oppression of LGBT rights in Africa, but acting as if its strictly an American caused problem is a bit short sighted. 

According to Pew Research, until recently, over 96% of Ugandans believed homosexuality was an unacceptable way of life that should not be tolerated. The most recent survey showed 11% of Ugandans find it morally acceptable, but that is a revelation over the past couple years. 

If you look at Uganda's neighbors, homosexuality is not accepted in the entire region. Only 1% in Tanzania, 1% in Kenya, and 4% in Rwanda find homosexuality to be acceptable. 

So acting as if these laws are mostly the doing of right-wing American Christians is a bit of a stretch. Do they support these laws, yes; are they the predominant factor behind them, very likely not.

I am far more complicated than a linear spectrum.  I am pro-understanding unintended consequences, and I am pro-associating externalities with the appropriate parties instead of aggregating them to affected parties.

&gt; Excessive fees and insurance polices are really just a way to keep the poor from having the means to protect themselves. It's class warfare and I won't stand for it.

This reads like a gibberish political talking point aimed at shutting down conversation instead of talking about what a sensible approach looks like.

&gt;And you seem to be all gung-ho when the ACLU does it

You're arguing against someone else, not me.

&gt;Because the war on drugs perpetuates the gang and drug culture and this the violence that everyone is so quick to freak out over but not so quick to look at critically.

Okay I am already against the was on drugs, so we're on the same side there, but I think equivocating the war on drugs with all urban violence is reductive to the point of absurdity. 

&gt;Why would we hold someone else accountable for the actions of others?

If your car is an accident you are liable for damages whether you were in it or not.  It is your responsibility as the owner of the vehicle unless it is stolen.  Insurance companies work hard to determine your individual risk factors.  If gun crime is as infrequent as you claim, then the insurance costs should be quite affordable.

&gt;But if your son (who has no criminal history or history of mental illness) shoots you in your sleep, then steals your guns from the gun safe, who are you demanding face justice here?

I'm not demanding anyone face justice in this case, anymore than a car owner would be demanded to face justice if their car was stolen.  The point is not to create a lynch mob.  The point is to create the same standard of accountability we keep in other common cases of risk, which the government handles millions of times daily with minimal complaint.  You require insurance/licensing or both depending on the risk level.  That's all I want.

If you want to make an argument against someone that wants something else, you're talking to the wrong guy.  I don't believe you can stop bad things from happening.  I have no interest in protecting people from their own stupidity.  I just think guns should be subject to the same common standard of risk management as everything else.  The fact that they are an exception is an absurdity given their potential for harm."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389978116.0,"&gt; And yet, we've had all these social programs for decades and people are still poor.

They help a lot though. Also, they're very piecemeal in nature, which is why I'm for basic income.

&gt;They used resources available to them to increase value to others' lives by bringing forth products and services. Other people and organization paid for those services freely. That's what makes it their money and not yours, and others who do not have it.

""freely"" is often used in a highly legalistic way. Accepting unfavorable employment conditions is often done under duress, for instance. 

You're not thinking like a sociologist. You're thinking from within the system, assuming the system is fair. While the system is what it is and I still would keep much of it, think outside the box for a minute. Look at all the social structures, our values and norms working here. Don't use the values to justify the values. Look at how over time, for instance, the game ultimately favors the rich as wealth inequality grows like it is now. Look at how without the wealth of the rich, either through job creation of wealth distribution, these guys would have nothing. We live in an interdependent society. That's what makes it where the wealth should be shared to a degree. I also don't propose forcing it ALL to be shared...I think that the values you propose should be balanced with the needs of others.

&gt;Scarcity still exists, my friend. We have more abundance now than ever in history--this is why our poor people can be obese. But that doesn't mean scarcity has disappeared.

Depends on the exact industry. As far as NEEDS go, I think we can supply everyone's NEEDS. WANTS, yeah, we still have scarcity. The point is, going back to healthcare, we have dozens of systems that adequately take care of people. They often do a better job than ours froma  purely utilitarian aspect. We should seek to be like them, because they produce better results, rather than throw the poor under the bus for the sake of ""progress.""

&gt;And how equal is ""equal enough"" for you? Why do you get to decide? If you don't, who does?

I don't have a set level of equality. But I will say we should at least find the current extreme levels to be problematic. I think we should at least seek to be like other first world countries. We have the stgratification many THIRD WORLD countries have. And that's a problematic.

&gt;our poorest people are fat

This is because of them eating unhealthy foods.

Also, food isn;'t the only measure of poverty. Keep in mind we were originally talking about healthcare.

&gt;The entire ""99% vs 1%"" argument is based solely on envy and spite.

I view it through a historical lense...that things WERE much more equal in the 50s and 60s, and now they're totally messed up again. Thanks trickle down economics.

&gt;They do benefit from hit. Have a look at your smart phone, or the internet we are using right now.

So SOME of it trickles down. Yet people still go without as far as their basic needs go. And we work harder than we have since before the great depression to bring in diminishing returns, which is part of it too.

THis isn't JUST about wealth, it's about power. The rich not only have wealth, they have the power to dictate how we live our lives. They determine how much we work, and for how long, and what what pay, and while we can theoretically bargain for it, if you try, they'll just say ***** you and throw you away in an instant. 

If we want to truly maximize individual freedom, like government power, economic power MUST be regulated. The peoples' needs MUST be cared for, or they'll ALWAYS have a proverbial gun to their head and be forced to act like slaves. Beyond that, I also just think peoples' needs should be cared for. Sorry if this makes me sound like an extremist.

I think the biggest difference between me and you here, si you seem to be making a lot of ideological arguments about fairness, while I look at the results. We have a lot of countries that are currently more equal, have higher tax rates, and still progress. Just look at Europe and all that clean energy stuff they're developing that we dont because it would hurt oil companies' bottom lines. WAKE UP. We really CAN have our cake and eat it too. I could care less about your ideological arguments about what you think is fair, because 1) i have a different idea of fairness and 2) I care about results.

You're making a libertarian case for ""fairness"" and ""progress"", but it doesn't sway me at all. I've heard it before. I reject these kinds of arguments."

So that justified killing them. It was common knowledge among ranchers that this would happen. Well this researcher went around looking for ranchers who had lost cattle this way. The ranchers never had it happen to them but their neighbor, but their neighbors all had the same story.

It turns out is was a wives tale, that was ""common knowledge"" but not based on any real evidence. Perhaps it has happened in the past but it was a lot rarer than anyone suspected. It turns out cattle are very careful where they step, that's why cattle guards (Texas gates in some places) work well.

Can you further define what you mean on those things?  Did you mean 'hunt' as in... using a gun or bow to try to bag some sort of animal or did you mean more like cruising for a temporary sexual partner?  Even though I use them a lot, I sometimes have a hard time interpreting implied meanings/metaphors/hyperbole, the issue isn't with your writing style.  It's with my perception in this case.

 I identify with a lot of what you say though.  I know what it feels like to be cruising on auto-pilot, not really feeling anything but staying between the lines on the pavement and sticking to the safest protocol possible for fear that turning off the main road to elsewhere could result in bad things. Personally, I know I'm not a sociopath because I feel empathy very powerfully but I have to shut it off and switch to intellectual empathy where I determine how to act toward people based on my history with that individual, what my head tells me they are feeling and how to treat them accordingly... rather than what my emotions tell me.  If I allowed my emotions and the empathy attached to them to run things then I'd be a complete mess who can barely function.  I also bear a lot of the classic symptoms of PTSD from trauma but I'm not going to get into the specifics on that right now.  Keep in mind also that I'm not a medical/psych professional... merely a guy who might be able to lend a helpful perspective based on personal experience. I'll ask you, have you gone through any sort of seriously traumatic stuff in your life at all? If so, how recent and what do you feel it's effect was?  What was your upbringing like?

**The foreign exchange market is a zero sum game[5] in which there are many experienced, well-capitalized professional traders (e.g. working for banks) who can devote their attention full-time to trading. An inexperienced retail trader will have a significant information disadvantage compared to these traders.**

**Retail traders are, almost by definition, undercapitalized. Thus, they are subject to the problem of gambler's ruin. In a ""Fair Game"" (one with no information advantages) between two players that continues until one trader goes bankrupt, the player with the lower amount of capital has a higher probability of going bankrupt first. Since the retail speculator is effectively playing against the market as a whole, which has vastly more capital, they will almost certainly go bankrupt. The retail trader always pays the bid/ask spread which makes their odds of winning less than those of a fair game. Additional costs may include margin interest or, if a spot position is kept open for more than one day, the trade may be ""resettled"" each day, each time costing the full bid/ask spread. In some variations of foreign exchange trading, forex dealers serve as the counterparty to the contracts sold to the retail customer. The underlying contract is not traded on an actual exchange such as the Chicago Board of Trade, but rather entered into off-exchange. Thus, if the investor loses money, while the dealer makes money**

SiriusCyberneticCorp,AskReddit,1389978402.0,"""The British accent."" Firstly, such a thing does not exist outside of films and TV. I would go so far as to say that the stereotypical posh voice is actually a non-accent and merely graduates in poshness, traits that relate to public schools and the class system. The BBC pronunciation that newsreaders adopt is another received accent, the diction of which is inculcated artificially. There are hundreds of regional accents and thousands of dialects, some are highly localised, peculiar to single cities or parishes. In an era of 3rd and 4th generation immigrants, regional and foreign accents have sort of interbred and taken on unique forms. The 'working class' accent, another misnoma, is generally a basterdised and exaggerated hybrid of northern dialects. In Scotland, there is a wonderful array of accents that are all undeniably Scottish, but nevertheless very different. The Irish have similar diversity. Many of our comedians make great capital from their regional accents, although it would be fair to say that regional accents are generally under-represented in our institutions, politics and cultural exports."

The thing is, I'm for personal freedom. I think people should have the right to do what they want and live as they want, as long as they don't harm others.

I'm for political freedom. I think that people should ahve a right to set their own course for policy, although I do think rights should be respected for the greater good (I don't think a libertarian approach to property is among these rights).

Economically? Eh. It's complicated. Because the least regulatory approach is NOT the one that guarantees the most freedom. Just like with the constitution limiting GOVERNMENT power, I believe businesses need to be limited in power to give the PEOPLE more freedom.

Example: While it is very possible to find feminists who state that men cannot be victims of rape,^1 you would be hard pressed to find MRA's stating that women cannot be victims of workplace fatalities, nor would you find any legal definitions of workplace fatalities to exclude women, or any push from the MRM to make them so. 

If you have data contradicting that men are the overwhelming majority (+90%) of workplace fatalities, I would happily admit I was wrong.

I've asked several people here and IRL who are ""all natural"" types about WHY that's so important to them. Not one of them has been able to give me a clear, concrete answer beyond, ""I don't know, I just am."" Just about every one of them is (to my knowledge) vaccinated, they all take antibiotics when they're sick, they take vitamins. We've evolved to a point where we have developed modern medicine to give us an advantage. I feel like it's denying our progress to not use it. 

In the end, if you don't want to use prescriptions to help you get pregnant, then don't--that's your choice and I'm glad you have the right to deny them. I guess I hope you have a good reason for it, but as of now, I'm not sure of that. I *really* hope you won't secretly think you're better than me for doing so (although I do have IRL examples of that being the case, and I see examples of that bias here all the time). I guess I have to accept that I can't relate well to some people who I feel are not using the tools they could be using. My best analogy is not really feeling all that sorry for my sister who constantly complains about not having enough money for the things she wants, but is unwilling to look for work. When I suggest jobs to her, I'm not trying to bring her down, I'm trying to help her bring herself up, but she still hates me for it. Similarly when I suggest clomid to anyone who is struggling to get pregnant without intervention, I am just trying to help that person reach her goal. The ire I get is response is in my opinion, confusing and unjustified. 

It may be of interest to note that here I am in my second round of clomid, having a usual O day of CD21, and I got a +OPK yesterday, on CD13. It makes me optimistic for this cycle."

foamster,AskMen,1389978624.0,"&gt; As opposed to the reformed Roman legion, that could take in any schlub off the street.

I mean, the ""Roman Legion"" went through several iterations over the centuries. Certainly the truely professional armies of the Empire and late Republic would have relied on conscription, but what made Roman Legions so goddamn effective was their training and cohesion. Even if you were some 'schlub,' if you lived long enough to retire you'd be guaranteed a plot of land to farm. Sounds like a pretty good deal relative to the other options at the time.

If I had my pick, though, it's easy: Roman equestrian.

Example: The other night, friends and I were sitting up on the rocks overlooking Kamishovo. We know a lot of people get killed there, fresh spawns running back back to corpses and so on.

So we sit there and we watch for geared up people murdering people in the town, we find a couple of people running around in there and shooting people, mostly in the middle of the street and run them off. Killed a couple, most logged. Whatever, its going well.

So we spot a guy with a big pack creeping along the beach, down that ridge, hiding. So i'm watching him. Then i hear the crack of a mosin as he fires on me, so i shoot to kill, get the kill and we slowly make our way down to make sure.

He's dead, and there is a fresh spawn next to him. We cuff him while we search the body and check the area and he finally speaks up while one of is us talking to him. Apparently, the guy was just protecting him and escorting him to the west.

So i guess we killed a guy just trying to help out a new spawn (who logged out in cuffs, but i don't blame him). But he shot at us first. Probably, both of us were being friendly, and helping new spawns, but because of a misunderstanding, there was a death."

The Hobbit got some critical pans because of how it played fast and loose with canon, and plenty of narmy, formulaic moments. The less said about The Lone Ranger, the better.

Honestly, the only movie nominated for that award that doesn't suffer from critical narm, formulaic nonsense, and plot holes large enough to fly the Enterprise through is Gravity. Yet, they all got Oscar nods, and Pacific Rim didn't.

Visual Effects nods are for visual effects. It's not supposed to matter how shitty your movie was. And visually, Pacific Rim is beautiful."

They're really intellectually curious, but they're still young enough that you get to have the fun moments of exposing them to brand new ideas and ways of thinking about the world all the time- they are really trying to figure out who they are and where they fit, and it's so much fun to watch their opinions and identities shift.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389978881.0,"First of all, $30k is totally unrealistic. $15k is a bit better.

Second, you get UBI even if you don't work.

Under my current plan, this is how it would work.

Janitor gets $35k a year from working. It's taxed at 40%. He pays $14,000 in taxes. He gets $15,000 in basic income.

He ends up walking away with $36k a year, AFTER TAXES.

If he had not worked, he would've only gotten $15k. So he's $21k better off working than not working. 

This is not the only way of doing this. Just my way."

That all aside we did visit a couple beaches but our friends took us to Maracas Bay.

Its not that we didn’t like the idea of connected cities, it’s that we were only given the choice of “always online”- we never had the option to kick it oldschool and just play by ourselves. And why was Always Online our only option? Not, as EA told us, because “the simulation can only be handled in the Cloud”, but because they wanted to eke out every dime from DRM-guarded DLC that they could. And their simulation was deeply flawed anyway; their much-vaunted Agents just picked random houses/jobs to live/work in, their energy/water couldn’t find the right paths, traffic almost invariably caused cities to collapse after a few hours, and the population of cities got artificially inflated, for what? To make the Population *look* more impressive?

That’s only focusing on the stuff that failed in a *single city*- I’m not even going to touch on how long it has taken them to get a Region to sync, or suchlike.

So, no, EA Madbro, your fanbase didn’t eviscerate you because you innovated. Your fanbase *called your asses out* when you lied to your customers and tried to craft excuses to deflect blame. And no, FTB Writerbro, SimCity fans didn’t “opt for another decade of the same”, we demanded to *not be lied to as if we’re fucking idiots*.

EDIT: Oh, and lest I forget: The abovementioned flaws in the Agent system were *intentionally hidden* from the Beta testers by limiting the Beta to, what- an hour, was it? They did this so that their incomplete product could be rushed to market before anyone knew they were buying something that needed another *year* of testing. So yeah. Neither EABro or Blogbro have a leg to stand on with trying to pin this on *us*. Jesus H."

Unfortunately, if your workflow involves digital in any way (scanning, posting online, manipulating in LR, etc., etc.,), you owe it to yourself to only ever do it once and then never do it again. Slide film is not designed for scanning, and you may never be satisfied with how the on-screen image appears compared to the beauty trapped in the emulsion.

missus_b,TryingForABaby,1389979162.0,"It's not the in-your-face type of abuse that happens on places like ""the bump"" and elsewhere. But around here, I've seen plenty of people say things like, ""I believe in my body."" Like I don't? I believe in my body's ability to carry a baby, but I understand I may need help getting to that point--I have a hormonal imbalance. Or, ""I hope they don't put you on drugs."" Why would that be so bad? Like the suggestion is such a horrible attack or something. Really, it's a very smart offer of help. I usually just ignore all these instead of responding to them, because I'm not trying to stir the pot (usually). 

It's all the innocent-sounding, high-horse business, and no one has a good reason for their position (that I've heard, anyhow). Even the words ""all natural"" versus ""unnatural"" are bothersome. And just yesterday you called the practice of trying to mature the quality of eggs with clomid (for women who do ovulate) ""dumb.""

0x_,SubredditDrama,1389979223.0,"I put in the same bracket as the waifu phenomenon, where someone lets their imagination sweep them up so much they're living in a fantasy anime world with their favorite animu character.

In their case they're probably unwittingly willing an imaginary thing more as a suspension of reality, than a meditative practise (see: tulpa forcing with tulpas).

Tulpas seem to have the same motivation, a companion, and people choose their subject they want to create, but its got a discipline and people share techniques which is way more specific and intentional and standardised.

Its Waifu 2.0.

Anyway the thing is once a ~~waifu~~tulpa has been finished, and has been forced fully into existence and completion, it is its own autonomous being, and as such, if you talk to it and tell it you are OK with accepting its advice, then absolutely i can imagine someone talking through their problems with it, and listening to advice/letting it tell them what they think they should do.

Vodafone has also a good network and is a bit cheaper. If I would be able to use them at my home I'd do.

O2, ePlus (+ thousands of other Carriers, but they all use the networks of these two) are still good in cites and populated areas, every where else they have a lot of holes in their coverage. If you can't test it. Its a gamble. But they are chap and often don't bind you to 2 year contracts.

They sell ""Flatrates"", but with hard datacaps. After 100MB-5GB (or whatever your plan has) you will be slowed to 64kbit/8kbit. And with todays usage this is just not enough to do anything.
